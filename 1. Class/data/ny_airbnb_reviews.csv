3831,588410318,We had a nice stay with Lisa in Brooklyn. Especially here tips were helpful and completely on point. Communication in general was very good.
3831,589143289,"The location it’s fantastic. Even it’s an entire place for your own doesn’t feel like it because don’t have door with you neighbors. The upside it’s your neighbor is your host who happens to ve very kind. 
Could be a bit more clean."
3831,597434314,"Lisa Roxanne was a great host and very accomodating. If you're looking for a great place to touchdown in Brooklyn, this is it!"
3831,598086924,DO NOT  stay here if your expecting anything like the photo or any peace & quiet . This place was a total mess not up to ABNB standards at all. You can definitely find a better room for this price .
3831,601064768,"LisaRoxanne's place is conveniently located close to many subway stops, and walking distance to attractions such as the BAM, restaurants and parks. 
The accommodations are comfortable, great king size bed, and clean. LisaRoxanne was responsive and flexible. Thank you!"
3831,603827773,"We loved it at Lisa's place. It was spacious, clean, and in a great location! Would definitely stay again!"
3831,604784306,3 guys that went to see a hockey game at Barclay Center the place was fine
3831,605419893,Great location and spot! LisaRoxanne is so kind and quick responder.
3831,608756560,"Very easy to communicate with, easy check-in and very accurate pictures. Great stay!"
3831,610088241,"We had an amazing stay. Lisaroxanne was very kind and welcoming.
We were able to leave a little bit later than the checkout time because our bus was leaving in the afternoon. Thank you so much for everything."
3831,615829006,"The place and Lisa are amazing! Very comfortable to stay and close to metro stations. The best host we’ve ever had, she even recomended places to go and everything was perfect. We had all we need at the house! I will definitely come back! "
3831,618105421,Knew we were having a sleepover and got upset by the music and the people then just decided to cal the cops and refuses to give me a full refund
3831,622211881,Very clean space!
3831,622571895,Worst Airbnb and I felt uncomfortable and left. What’s in the picture is not what you going to get in person real talk.
3831,623159807,The place was very comfortable and clean. The host has great hospitality. the area is also nice and quiet The only issue I had is the lay out cause it wasn’t completely private like I thought it was by looking at the pics but other then that it was a good experience.
3831,624414254,This place is very comfortable and feels like home.  Definitely recommend anyone to book this place.  I most definitely will be again
3831,627009099,Good place to stay the night
3831,627460802,"Lisa was great and her space was perfect for a short visit. I had my pup with me and was able to bring her and keep her there without a problem when I left the house. Amenities were all there, and everything was clean. Had a good quick stay and the value is great. Thanks for everything!"
3831,628323141,Very good upstairs just it was stuffy that’s all
3831,629077633,Needed a bed in NYC for a night. This was perfect for exactly that.
3831,629701271,"It was great, clean and convenient."
3831,630399913,LisaRoxanne was an excellent host - she made sure we had everything we needed. Great neighborhood!
3831,631145536,Great airbnb for a nice stay within the city
3831,631858119,Simple but great place.
3831,632319520,i wouldnt recommend this bnb it states family lives down below but it should definitely be more cleaner if you going to have people walk through your home the fridge was disgusting cabinets full of old groceries and there should be no reason i have to clean to be able to cook pots where greasy and nasty if it wasnt for my daughter i wouldnt have cooked because it definitely messed up my appetite. step railing isnt secure very unsafe
3831,632983152,Not as shown.
3831,636881404,"It's in a great area - easily walk-able to many restaurants, subway stops, Fort Green Park etc. 
If you're planning a short stay and plan to be out a lot it's a great find - there are 3 young children in the house below and sound travels up so if you're looking to work or rest/read probably not the best. Lisa was nice and accommodating."
3831,638200284,LisaRoxanne got back to me with answers to my questions right away and was very accommodating. The place was very comfortable and she had the AC turned on for us before we got there which was great :) I would definitely recommend this spot and stay again someday.
3831,638447334,"I have encountered many efficient and considerate hosts via Airbnb, but none of them come close to LisaRoxanne. Not only was she incredibly understanding when I had to change my original reservation, when a family emergency forced me to leave her place only hours after my arrival, she refunded half my money purely out of her own generosity. I had not remotely expected her to do this and so was not only very grateful to her for her kindness, but also deeply touched. But even before I had arrived at her clean, comfortable and sunlit apartment, LisaRoxanne had responded rapidly and efficiently to my every question or request and had been completely straightforward, considerate and understanding. She was there waiting for me when I arrived, and her apartment's eat-in kitchen turned out to be larger than I expected, with a view out onto sunlit treetops, which was both beautiful and felt private. I will also add that LisaRoxanne has a subtle but spot-on sense of humor and that there is a feature in her apartment that will be much appreciated by any pandemic-weary visitor."
3831,638757201,"Re: any critical reviews on this place -- read the listing! I feel that the description is accurate. While you can hear people downstairs and the stairs lead directly up to your third floor, no one is walking through your space and your bedroom door does shut. For the price I would say this is a good find, good neighborhood! Would not bring a finicky neatfreak to stay here but for a quick stopover it suited our needs well. Family was pleasant. :)"
3831,639130377,Wonderful and courteous. Perfect location. Safe area. Suitable for couples or a family with small children. All around great host.
3831,642808077,"I felt like I was in the heart of Brooklyn, the house is right near a nice local garden. Bus stop is right on her block and the A&C train is about a 10 minute walk. The food places in the Bedford are spread out so just rent a bike and you're good honestly. Inside was cozy as well."
3831,643336638,"We made our reservation last minute and also had to change our checkout day during our stay, but she took care of it all quickly for us. It seems like it would be a good place for a long stay, with a homely atmosphere. I hope we have the chance to stay again. Thank you!"
3831,643704849,"Clean, convenient. Communication could be better."
3831,644715095,"We had a nice stay, everything was good."
3831,645249600,Great communication. Convenient location. Very hospitable.
3831,647398247,This spot was exactly as expected and Lisa was friendly host.
3831,649012172,"it is  very simple , modest ,private  apartment on the 3 rd floor  in an  well paced neighborhood. With nice Restaurants  & bars.  the host was very accommodating & responded quickly."
3831,649831759,LisaRoxanne’s space is great. It’s super functional and the a/c in the bedroom is a godsend.
3831,651035776,Host was very flexible with our check in and check out times. She responded quickly as well! Exactly what we needed for two nights in Brooklyn.
3831,651594670,The space was much smaller than expected. Couldn’t leave bedroom door open or it’ll get warm very fast.
3831,652890773,"nice location closed to Brooklin bridge  , easy access ."
3831,653201038,Lisa is an amazing host and her family is great too. The location was gorgeous and there’s plenty to eat around the air bnb.
3831,653908049,It was a nice place
3831,655535287,"LisaRoxanne is very friendly and quick to respond, the place you can tell is thoroughly cleaned and overall was great for my needs! Thank you LisaRoxanne."
3831,659114872,"Nice, unique space with plenty of light and room. LisaRoxanne was also an amazing host!"
3831,659646084,"As advertised!  I had a most relaxing and enjoyable stay at LisaRoxanne's place and would most assuredly return.   Everything was easily navigated, a parking spot across the street and most hospitable responses to my needs around arrival time and entrance.  The speed of response to my request to book was also appreciated."
3831,662939253,"The place was simple and great. It reminded us a lot of our apartment in Brooklyn, which we missed. The location is prime near a ton of great places to eat."
3831,666378070,"Great location, clean and comfortable. Hostess was friendly and helpful."
3831,667545152,"This is definitely a great bang for your buck! It’s the entire third floor of the host’s home, but the stairwell is separated so there is plenty of privacy. We only interacted with the (very helpful!) host over AirB&B, we never bumped into each other in the home. I really appreciated this, especially with Covid protocol. 

If you’re looking for a place to crash while you’re out enjoying the city, I’d definitely recommend!"
3831,669401713,"LisaRoxanne is a wonderful host! Her place is a classic Brooklyn Brownstone with a lot of character. You have to walk up the stairs through the house to get to the top floor, but once you’re there it’s a haven. She takes care of little details that make you feel special (extra tooth brush, tooth Paste, shower supplies, and it does feel very clean, albeit it is an older building. 

Overall I had a great experience and her and her family are super sweet."
3831,669900510,"It was a nice space, only a 10 min walk from the subway station to get around NY as well as bus stops right near by to get around Brooklyn. 

Towels and toothbrushes were provided which was extra nice. My friend and I were there for 2 nights so we were out most of the time but there was also a kitchen and dining area on our floor (3rd) where we could’ve cooked if we wanted."
3831,670494917,"Awesome host. This is the most comfortable I have felt in an AirBnB. It was clean to my liking and the temperature was comfortable. The host was responsive, relatable, and so understanding. I would absolutely stay here again."
3831,671021299,LisaRoxanne's place is just as described and shown in the pictures. Great location and easy to find free street parking. She was good at communicating and very accommodating. I highly recommend her place. I will stay here again next time I plan a trip to New York.
3831,671893297,Lisa Roxanne was easy to communicate with and the apartment was very nice and private.
3831,700183238,"It's a separate floor of a multi floor family apt. You will hear the family. I needed a clean crash pad to visit family and it was what I needed. You get what you pay for - a socially distanced floor, in a great location, for a good price."
3831,700639144,"Kind host, good location, good value"
3831,701162529,"LisaRoxanne is a very kind host and person. The first thing you notice is that the place is very clean. This rental is a wonderful find, and a great value for the money. The bedroom has lots of space, as does the kitchen. 

The bed is super comfortable. We slept well. We loved the hardwood floors and beautiful old victorian banister and steps. The third floor is broken up into half at the top of the stairs. On one side is the kitchen and bathroom, the other side is the bedroom. I would pay more for the space if the bedroom was styled a little bit. It is basic, has everything you could need. The kitchen has a nice style to it, and both areas are very clean.

I really wish I could have given a full 5 stars, but the host didn't respond until after I called customer service. (The check in instructions say to confirm where the key will be ahead of time.) It normally wouldn't have been as big of deal to me if I had to wait in the rain a little. However, because I was on crutches it would have been a problem. I needed to know before I arrived that I could get in. 

It all worked out great in the end though. I highly recommend LisaRoxanne's place! And would stay her again."
3831,701787101,Great spot for an overnight in Brooklyn
3831,702132162,LisaRoxanne was a great host! She was quick with responses and was very flexible with our check in time. She was also very thoughtful and offered us her parking spot when I informed her we were struggling to find parking on the street!
3831,702782122,"Great location and lovely neighborhood, super flexible and kind host, great windows views and nice to have a private kitchen and bathroom!"
3831,703695715,"LisaRoxanne’s place was great. We had the entire too floor to ourselves. LisaRoxanne was nice, helpful, and generally inviting while the place had all the amenities needed to make your stay excellent. The apartment was very close to anything and everything you need. Bus stop, metro stop, local coffee shop, local eateries, playgrounds, grocery stores, etc. the location was perfect. I will definitely stay there again when heading back to Brooklyn."
3831,704656672,"Lisa is a wonderful person. She is communicative. Lisa provides everything like 5-star hotels. Free parking in the area, but it is difficult to get a parking due to the crowding. Close to Classon station, five minute walk. There is a small grocery store next to the house with a bus stop. A great place to stay and I recommend it."
3831,704861057,"Awesome stay, would return! Great location and very clean. Thank you so much!"
3831,705892711,"Great place, great service, and solid location! You will be staying on the third floor of her house, as opposed it being its own apartment. So you get privacy however, it just might not be what you'd expect. Overall, I would absolutely stay here again."
3831,707108404,Excellent location in one of my favorite neighborhoods in New York. Very clean and private space. LisaRoxanne was an excellent and very accommodating host.
3831,708730374,Lisa's place is very similar to her pictures. It was a great stay and great location. She's there to answer any questions and the space truly does feel private even with the shared staircase.
3831,709381982,"Very helpful, very convenient and just an overall great stay! Definitely would visit again."
3831,709623761,Lisa Roxanne was a great post I would recommend her to other travelers and I would stay there again
3831,710578914,Her place was as described and a great value for the location. Would recommend as a place to crash at night after you explore NY
3831,712225805,Good location and great experience!
3831,713104330,"I really enjoyed my stay at LisaRoxane place. It's very clean and comfortable,: )"
3831,716074610,"Lisa is amazing, she was so hospitable and friendly, very easy going and was an exceptional host!!! 10/10 would definitely stay here again!"
3831,717399606,It was a nice place to stay in Brooklyn.
3831,717870063,"This was such a great location in Brooklyn! We even had no issue finding street parking overnight. 
LisaRoxanne was very accommodating and it was the perfect place for home base during our quick trip through the city."
3831,719400252,LisaRoxanne was so nice and hospitable. She was so quick to answer my texts and the place was awesome- exactly as described. Felt like I had my own Brooklyn flat! My car got to weed I’m the morning and she was kind enough to look it up for me and drive me to wear it was towed. So so nice. Would recommended this place to any and all!
3831,721596793,"I really like it, she was nice and the places was organize and clean."
3831,722183142,You can expect a clean & large space. The host is professional & kind.
3831,723999945,"Great location, great communication and great hospitality."
3831,724924853,Great location. The rooms were clean and comfortable
3831,726611179,Great place!
3831,727023568,"Good Place. Bathroom and Kitchen really clean, bedroom not so clean but I say this because I am a clean freak so its okay. Its definitely worth the money. I would definitely stay here again."
3831,727152250,"LisaRoxanne’s space offers all the basics you need, including a well equipped kitchen with a large refrigerator.  Unfortunately, it wasn’t as private as I needed. LisaRoxanne makes a point of saying the apartment is on the top floor of her home, but I had imagined it differently than what it was. Before arriving, I was picturing a space that was enclosed behind a door at the top of the stairs. But the kitchen area opens directly to the staircase and the stairs run through the center of the family home. My work requires confidentiality, so I realized once I got there that it wouldn’t work for me to conduct teletherapy at the dining table. LisaRoxanne was very understanding and allowed me to check out early. I never saw her face to face, which is good with the pandemic, but she was very responsive over text. The other residents were very quiet while I was there. If you don’t need total privacy and want a crash pad where you can cook and read, this is a great value."
3831,730209751,"Lisa was super kind and helpful whenever we needed something; she even helped us to get a reservation for our Covid test in a medical center (required for our flight).
We were three people staying there and the space was more than enough and comfortable. The kitchen was nicely equipped and we used it a lot.
Also, the temperature inside the house was great. We were staying there during a snow storm, and inside the apartment it was super warm.
8 minute walk to a subway station (which we used a lot) and 5 minute walk to supermarkets.
It was a nice stay ☺ Thanks Lisa for everything!"
3831,731150551,A decent value choice in a great neighborhood. Minutes from the Franklin Ave. (C) and the G stops.
3831,731541176,HOARDER HOUSE ‼️ I recommend nobody stay here everrrrrrrrrr .. she have 3 kids she left home alone she got the right one . I’m callin the people on you girl . I didn’t even stay my whole time ‼️She really needed that 88$ Realllll sad Roxanne. Goodbye I have so much to say but I won’t just call the cleaning company YOU NEED IT SIS ‼️ Real baddddd BED BUG SPRAY IN HER CABINET LMAO bye u SHOULDVE left me alone we wasn’t bothering u . Your kids was very annoying ‍♀️ on Valentine’s Day at that .
3831,732636605,"Great value and great, safe, up-and-coming neighborhood; this is an especially great option if you want to get out to an area that not many tourists make it to. The space was clean and the LisaRoxanne was responsive and kind. Just be aware that there is no door separating the AirBnB space from the stairwell that connects to the other levels of the building (there IS a bedroom door, of course, that can function as the separator)"
3831,732864204,"LOCATION!! VALUE!! Perfect for last minute bookings and one night stays. Close to everything and in a beautiful neighborhood. You are in a family home and so be aware that a family lives there, you can hear people talking and other household noise. Otherwise a great place to stay if you need a quick booking with all the amenities you might want.  PS: newly renovated kitchen :)"
3831,735235077,"LisaRoxanne's place is a good place to stay! I was there for about a week while I looked at apartments in the area. There is a ton of space, which is hard to come by in the city. I really liked having the bedroom to rest in and the kitchen/dining area to eat and work. LisaRoxanne was very nice, friendly and accomodating! It's not the fanciest place, but it certainly does the trick for a spacious crash pad."
3831,739404358,"Lisa was a great hostess! An unforeseen issue came up, and she refunded me for my stay right away. She's a very nice person, and fun to talk to."
3831,740339396,"Great value for the price. Host was very nice and helpful, made our trip easy!"
3831,746860597,"Pros: The kitchen is great. The cookware is top of the line for an airbnb (Website hidden by Airbnb) The bedroom is comfortable (Website hidden by Airbnb) The apartment is spacious (Website hidden by Airbnb) The bathroom is very nice, though you get some hot blasts in the shower from time to (Website hidden by Airbnb) time.
Cons: We wish there was a wall and a door on the third floor to seal off the kids' noise from (Website hidden by Airbnb) the second floor."
3831,747878648,Great host.
3831,748222819,Great place and very hospitable and accommodating host
3831,748915001,"I stayed here with my partner for just one night. really affordable and great location! just a heads up. you're staying in one part of a house that a family lives in. They are super nice and respectful, but you can hear them from the Airbnb in the morning and early evening. That wasn't a problem for us at all, but might be a problem if you're looking for truly your own space."
3831,749864823,LisaRoxanne was incredibly friendly and accommodating!
5178,587844402,"Great location, great amenities, great flexibility for checkin and luggage storage. The room got more than everything you need. Sometimes the toilet was not flushing properly, but everything else were alright during our short stay."
5178,592251184,Great location.  Close to so much.  Great value.
5178,598952933,"Building was old, flat looked old too. I would say that this is the only bad thing about this, but... HE Y! almost whole Manhattan is old so it wasn't a flaw. Everything was perfect. :)"
5178,600353982,"A true gem!!! I was on a solo trip to explore the city and mostly watch musicals! This location was the most perfect. Easy access to tkts Lincoln center AND times square locations, so I got amzing tickets every day, wed and sat twice a day! Food is all around u! 24/7. The room is very simple, but very comfortable, hard bed (I hate soft beds) nice pillows everything changed clean and fresh! He was also super nice when giving me the keys, and so flexible with check in/out time. I HIGHLY recommend this place, for solo travelers that needs a ny style place to stay for very affordable and in the middle of the action! Im booking again for may and August."
5178,604840818,"Shunichi was an excellent host. He stayed up late to meet me on the 
night that I arrived and he responded promptly by text to the few
questions I had during my stay. The room had not only a bed and desk,
but also its own refrigerator and microwave. The location was very
convenient and the price reasonable. I would definitely stay with
Shunichi again if I visit Midtown Manhattan."
5178,606760196,A simple and peaceful retreat after a long day in the city. Much appreciated the unintrusive hospitality.
5178,609277533,"Great location, great price, and has all you need for a place to come back to at the end of the night after a day of exploring. The room & bathroom could use some cleaning, but the bed itself was clean and for my stay that’s all I really needed."
5178,609923927,"Not fancy, but functional, and a great location."
5178,611610118,That’s amazing location :)
5178,612023468,Great location.
5178,615910207,Great location and price for an NYC trip. Host was always responsive and helpful
5178,618663219,Great location!
5178,667781125,"This place is located in a convenient midtown location, near transportation. It’s near a busy avenue so can be loud at times. The room was comfortable and had everything I needed."
5803,598603219,"The house is at a perfect location in park slope, one of the best neighbourhoods of brooklyn. Lots of restaurants and bars nearby. Also the subway station is one block away. In 25 minutes in mid-town manhattan. The house has a nice atmosphere and  is very clean. Lots of suggestions by our host for activities to do in NY."
5803,613651586,"Laurie's package of info is a wealth of info. And, of course, so is she! Whatever you need or are seeking, she has suggestions to help make this happen. Convenient location with lots of space. Ideal place to explore Park Slope."
5803,619687618,Laurie was so kind and offered my friend and me because of the Covid 19 situation the apartment (flat)  instead of the room we booked. The apartment is very cosy and furnished with love. The area Park Slope is full of nice shops and restaurants. The booklet Laurie send us was very useful. Thank you :)
5803,662423737,"My situation was unique in that I stayed in Laurie's beautiful old home during a quarantine in preparation for my son's wedding. I had the place mostly to myself, but the location and the space was perfect. It was quiet and close to plenty of food and wine needs. Her cats - Batman and Robin - kept me company and kept me from missing my own furry babies back home. I especially enjoyed the back garden on a cool afternoon. As quarantines go, it was pretty nice!"
5803,701169161,Great place to stay and great hospitality!
5803,747112420,Beautiful home and great location. Laurie is super welcoming and helpful. Would absolutely stay again in a heartbeat!
6848,610471301,"Decent, not great. The bed was comfortable, but the mattress protector had a huge coffee-like stain on it and the bed skirt was dusty. The photos are enhanced to make this below-grade apartment seem brighter than it actually is. Minimal amenities; not even any coffee unless someone before you was generous enough to leave some behind. We were left with someone’s decaf and some old tea. You can hear outside noise, but that’s to be expected. What’s not expected was being able to hear everything from the hosts upstairs. VERY thin walls. We could hear them walking around, opening doors, coughing, etc. Also their bird. I don’t know what kind of bird it was, but it’s a loud screeching type, not a small chirping bird. It wasn’t very active until the morning we were checking out when it was squawking very loudly all morning long. The hosts were also stomping around upstairs, repeatedly going up and down the stairs outside the apt door, and opening/closing heavy doors all morning. I don’t know whether all of this activity was intentional, but since no other morning was that excessively noisy other than the one on check out day, it sure felt intentional and very rude. Maybe they have had other guests overstay past check out time, but that’s really no reason to punish future guests.

There are better deals with the new pod hotels that are cleaner and closer to where you want to be. We’ll be going that route next time."
6848,612029321,Good apartment!!
6848,613247747,Irina was a gracious host. The apartment is large for NYC. Great location!
6848,615261296,"Allen & Irina are great hosts. My partner and I stayed at this studio apartment for a week during a networking trip and it was perfect. Large private studio a few blocks from the subway, perfect for a weekend or long term stay! Would recommend to anyone going to NYC looking for a private place."
6848,616364517,"Allen and Irina's studio is quite lovely! Very well decorated and spacious enough to spread your things out and relax. Perfect for two guests. We loved the location -- very close to coffee shops, restaurants, bars and just a quick metro ride into the city! We did not stay long enough to utilize the kitchen, but it seems perfect for guests who want to cook during their stay!"
6848,619071518,"There are a lot of noise, not only from the neighbourhood, but you can hear everything from the hosts who live upstairs. They have a bird or another animal that makes noises all day long and night. Additionally, every morning it sounded like someone was trying to break down the window in the kitchen - rather disturbing."
7097,595658025,This is a lovely garden apartment in The Ft Greene neighborhood - great location for visiting Brooklyn and Manhattan.  Spacious and comfortable..    Jane was a super host...  I hope to go back soon.
7097,603398188,She is so kind. The house is beautiful and retio~I love it
7097,607281950,"Second time booking with Jane. Great place. Great neighborhood. Comfortable bed, luxe linens, awesome shower! Sunny kitchenette with garden view."
7097,609824428,"This place is a gem! Quiet, comfortable, stylish, great location! 
Bed is comfortable, plenty of room to relax after dinner or sightseeing, and a great shower!! Jane was amazing  with her responses and accomodated our needs. We will definitely stay here again when back

7097,617996452,Just an excellent place to stay
7097,633598355,Jane's place has a stunning garden just one block from Fort Greene park. She was very responsive and accommodating - including upgrading the wifi router when we were having connectivity issues. Checkin and checkout was seamless.
7097,634330909,Great host. Place was spotless and the open concept throughout the house is amazing.  I would definitely stay again. Thanks again Jane
7097,635415278,Beautifully decorated and a great location! Jane was very helpful and accommodating. Would definitely stay again!
7097,636202521,Jane was a lovely host. The hospitality was outstanding and the home was sparkling clean. I would highly recommend staying here for a relaxing getaway.
7097,640541934,"I wanted a short stay for rest and relaxation, and this beautiful place was definitely it. Jane was very accommodating with my last minute booking. The place is absolutely beautiful, and the back yard is peaceful and serene.Great location, area very quiet. Will definitely stay again in the near future."

7097,665463808,"Just as advertised and a bit more, we would stay again, hopefully COVID is gone next time but great nonetheless!"
7097,667069179,"I cannot even begin to say how lovely Jane and her home was. The place itself is beautiful, very ornate and the details of the place are amazing. The space was even larger than the pictures. It’s in a very nice location with an easy walk to several subway stations. Jane was such a kind host – the best I’ve ever personally had staying at an Airbnb. She helped us out-of-towners navigate the subway, parking, and was friendly and quick to respond to any questions or inquiries. We will definitely be back in the future!"
7097,669080614,"Jane’s place is well-appointed and had everything we needed - a well-stocked kitchenette, comfortable beds, a clean bathroom with great water pressure, and lots of charm. It also has a fabulous outdoor space.

Check-in and checkout were easy, and Jane was very accommodating. She offered to make up the pullout couch for us before we arrived, which was helpful. 

The property is located on a picturesque, tree-lined street. We took a road trip to visit family and easily found street parking nearby. The location felt safe and although we didn’t go out much because of the pandemic, it’s within walking distance of lots of coffee shops, corner groceries, and restaurants. We visited beautiful Fort Greene Park a number of times, about a block away. There’s a great farmers market there on Saturdays."
7097,705435055,Lovely comfortable apartment.  Beautiful  backyard and great location.  Jane is very accommodating and thoughtful.  We had a wonderful stay . Would cone back again
7097,707423486,"We’ve stayed here twice and will reserve again. Large rooms, large and comfortable bed. Lovely outdoor space. Convenient location close to the park."
7097,708043970,This apartment was wonderful and I felt very confident that it was clean the moment I walked in. I would absolutely stay here again.
7097,708338146,There is a lovely garden and a nice living room with a big tv hooked up to cable.  The wifi is good.  And the shower has great water pressure.  It is a very cute apartment in a lovely location.
7097,708995498,"Jane's place is fantastic.  Great location, perfectly clean, and comfortable.  Jane even left fresh flowers for us in the kitchen, much appreciated touch!"
7097,713435857,"Jane was a great host. She was quick in communicating, flexible when our plans changed and very accommodating. The apartment was very clean and well kept. It is very well located just a block from Fort Green park and a short walk to restaurants and transit lines, yet is very quiet with very little street noise. There is a nice view on to the back garden."
7097,720990273,"Jane was an excellent host, quick and thoughtful communication, offered additional space if needed, very accommodating.  Excellent WiFi/internet, large TV w/cable, remodeled shower, seemingly isolated from street noise.  A very short walk to Forte Green park and local businesses.  A very nice outdoor garden space to view from inside or walk into. A great location."
7097,722775693,"Lots of light in the kitchen, huge comfy couch + ottoman. Quality wood floors and tile bathroom. I felt like I had a calm retreat in the middle of Ft. Greene."
7097,724049112,"Jane’s space is perfect for a special city stay. Jane herself is thoughtful, attentive, and kind. We’re grateful to her for letting us stay there twice now."
7097,726829088,great place great host
7097,746636507,"It’s hard to describe just how beautiful this location is. If the huge, sunny backyard isn’t enough roaming ground for you, you’re just a few paces from Fort Greene park. There’s a real feeling of serenity and charm here."
7097,748930589,"We had a lovely stay at Jane's beautiful apartment and garden.  So spacious and comfortable (particularly the king size bed!). The garden is extraordinary with its magnolias in full bloom, tulips and daffodils and we loved experiencing life for a week on one of the prettiest neighborhoods in Brooklyn so close to our family.  Far superior to a hotel stay.  We highly recommend and will be back!"
7097,750768335,Jane’s place was great. Very spacious. Amazing outdoor space. Unique light filled kitchenette. High end bathroom. The neighborhood is full of restaurants and cafes. Very quiet and good internet. Jane is super easy to communicate with and a lovely host.
7097,752420203,Great place and conveniently located for our needs.
7097,753297851,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Janes. The location was ideal for us. The listing well represented the apartment and the back yard was a beautiful retreat. We intend to come back!
8490,604208369,"It is a charming, cozy space with lots of character. My sisters, niece and I enjoyed cooking together, snuggling up chatting and laughing in what felt like a sweet vacation cabin In country."
8490,637841410,"Natalie's place was stylish, eclectic and comfortable. The balcony and living rooms a were definitely our favorite. A big daybed full of pillows on the balcony was perfect for us to enjoy the cool night air and each other's company. There are many comfy places to lay your head and sage to clear the air and unwind. Great value for such a large space."
8490,640519740,"I’ve been to a lot of Airbnb’s in Brooklyn, but this is by far one of my favorites.  The place is clean and very very cozy.  If you sit down to watch tv you might just wind up napping.  The place is amazing, from decor to patio, to the way everything has been arranged.  Even the old style bathroom was cool.  If it wasn’t for Covid there’d be a lot of bars open nearby.  Still, a great experience if you want to stay in."
8490,661654540,"Nathalie’s home is an absolute dream in the heart of Bed- Stuy. Booking couldn’t have been a simpler process as Nathalie is extremely communicative and responded nearly immediately. Read the rules! Everything is very clear! No stress check in, arrive and use the lockbox whenever you’re ready. Once you open the door you’re going to fall in love and want to cancel any and all plans to go out (you’re also going to wake up on Sunday and immediately extend your reservation.. just trust me and book Sunday night as well.) The backyard space paired with a glass of wine and the essence of whatever vibe is happening on the block is prime entertainment in and of itself. You’re in the heart of Bed- Stuy with access to the train only a few blocks down giving you the accessibility to explore whatever part of town you’re in the mood for although you can find almost any vibe you’re looking for within a few blocks. Early mornings in Nathalie’s space was really prime time though, the natural light that streams through all the windows in the apartment was so beautiful to wake up to. As someone who’s been traveling to New York over the past few years, Nathalie’s home was genuinely everything I could’ve asked for. Do yourself a favour and experience it for yourself!!"
8490,706248397,"Nathalie's home is lovely with really interesting decorations. She was also very responsive, even when I was having wifi trouble. (Thank you very much!) I'd recommend staying in Nathalie’s brownstone."
8490,707422066,"Love the space and the patio! A true brownstone on a Brooklyn treelined block, absolutely gorgeous."
8490,714741472,"Beautiful apartment, tons of natural light, great host and perfect location"
8490,715562290,Beautiful place. I stay coming back for a relaxing time. Nathalie is great.
8490,721541125,"Our stay at Nathalie's place was quiet, cozy, and restful. Her place is in Bed-Stuy on a quiet block, but close to some of the main streets in Bed-Stuy and Crown Heights. We spent our days reading, taking baths, and eating pastries and pizza from nearby Saraghina. Nathalie's prompt communication and contact-less check-in made for an easy arrival & settling in."
8490,723679249,"Nathalie’s place was just lovely and I wanted to write a very honest review for future guests to know exactly what their receiving. I’ve stayed in over 200 Airbnb’s throughout my four year travels and this apartment really stood out for me. The apartment is definitely much more beautiful in person with hand picked pieces that were really put in with love and care. I honestly expected it to be a little dusty because there was a lot of antique pieces but nope, I really felt like home, each pillow I laid on smelled fresh, everything in the apartment was thoroughly cleaned, it just made me feel so comfortable. Nathalie took care of each aspect of the apartment making it warm and cozy with absolutely gorgeous finishes. I loved her style and sense of cleanliness, really would have stayed longer if I could.

Also, the neighborhood was quite lovely as well. Lots of art, culture and great food, transport right at your feet. 

Nathalie was always prompt in communicating back and making sure my stay was going well. This was an awesome place to stay, I thoroughly enjoyed my time here and I hope there will be availability in the future. 

Thank you kindly Nathalie for having us, we really appreciate your hospitality."
8490,726530654,"Nathalie’s place was amazing ! Everything was clean and I loved having the full kitchen so I could cook . The terrace was amazing and Nathalie responded very quick when we would communicate. 
The sunlight coming in through the windows in the morning was outstanding! And the place was laid out very very well. I loved all the decorations and everything and it was very peaceful! I would definitely stay again!"
8490,730241544,Very cozy spot! Great place to spend the day in just relaxing but also centrally located to head out into the city. Would stay again!
8490,731582946,"These pictures don’t do Nathalie’s home justice - as great as it looks, it’s even better in person. So unique, amazing natural light, and you can tell how thoughtfully everything has been chosen in the apartment - overall it’s one of my favorite places I’ve stayed. Great location & Nathalie was super communicative & accommodating as well. Would love to stay again in the future"
8490,743815315,"Nathalie’s place was a perfect spot for my mom while she visited me in Bed Stuy. Easy check in and check out, perfect location, beautiful decor, and a private terrace! Will definitely book again. Thank you Nathalie!"
8490,747346037,"Wonderful apartment that feels super unique and cozy, with the deck space outside it's the perfect spot for a staycation and close to tons of great food! Loved the time here and would definitely come back again!"
8490,750595747,Such a cute space!!! Probably the most adorable apartment I've ever stayed in. There's a nice little PRIVATE back patio that's great for warmer nights :) The whole space has a very charming vintage feel. The train is a fairly close walk and so are lots of good delis and restaurants. Friendly neighbors as well.
8490,751868696,An amazing little place in a great part of town.
9657,669601823,Dana's place is really the Best location you can stay at in NYC. A super stylish pad in a building with pre-war charm in the heart of the artistic core of the east village. A really great Italian restaurant downstairs. Top.
9657,706950147,"Dana's place has multiple things going for it, not least being location. It's convenient to a lot in the neighbourhood. The space itself  was nice and comfortable. It's a little bit dark, though no more so than any other East Village place. Because I was there during COVID and cooking more than I would have otherwise I did note that the kitchen doesn't have a lot of working space. But that's going to be an individual preference.

Dana was very easy to reach and made everything smooth and simple. She was a great host, and I'd recommend her place to anyone."
9657,739393776,"Dana's apartment is beautiful. The bedroom is spacious with tons of natural light. the living area is spacious as well with attached kitchen which is standard NYC size (small). the shower is great, it is a 4th floor walk up which I personally love (good exercise) and allows for amazing light in the apartment which you dont always get in Manhattan, especially East Village and older neighborhoods. Dana's response time was consistently lightning fast which I very much appreciated! she was helpful and accommodating. highly recommend and would def stay again! ❤"
9704,618066036,"Teri is an AMAZING host. Her apartment is super chic and comfortable. Amazing location--very close to subway, awesome restaurants and coffee shops nearby. Teri is super warm and welcoming.  I had a wonderful time staying at her home!"

10452,744386398,I’ve stayed in a bunch of air bnbs and Angela was by far one of the best hosts. She kept the place super clean and even offered to take care of the laundry throughout my stay. She responded within 5 mins of me needing anything. She was happy and always willing to go above and beyond for anything I needed. She’s a sweetheart and she made it feel like it was my own home. Definitely recommend this place to anyone

10962,603744349,"Laurie’s place is a gem, perfectly located in prime Park Slope, which is basically New York’s version of Islington. The house is a quirky, older home, warm and welcoming. Laurie is an extremely interesting person, friendly, knowledgeable and delighted to chat about everything from the locality to the state of the world. The upstairs rear bedroom I had was quiet and comfortable - I slept particularly well. It’s probably worth noting that the house could be tricky for anyone not steady on their feet as the stairs are narrow and steep. But don’t worry about taking bags up there - Laurie is more than happy to let guests keep heavy bags downstairs. The bathroom is shared if there’s another guest in residence, but the arrangement wasn’t at all stressful - and even though the plumbing isn’t in it’s salad days, the shower is super powerful in the best American tradition - which was a pleasure each morning. Highly recommended, an easy subway trip to the varied neighbourhoods of Brooklyn and to Manhattan beyond."

12937,598601369,"Wonderful place to stay, very clean, easy access, close to the subway, and some tasty places to eat nearby."
12937,603715481,"I have stayed many times at Orestes over the years and I will be coming back. The room is quiet, the bathroom is awesome, you can hear the birds in the morning and sleep well at night, while being in Manhattan in literally 15 minutes. This time, I came with my son who is 14 and we had a blast visiting the city. He also enjoys very much staying at Orestes, it was his third times."
12937,604807702,Orestes and Gus are kind and welcoming. Great stay! I would highly recommend!
12937,607359210,"A wonderful stay in an awesome location with great amenities and privacy! The hosts are absolutely lovely people, easy to communicate with and very welcoming, and gave excellent recommendations for yummy local food! The courtyard and the amazing shower alone are worth experiencing - but everything from the small details to the convenience of the location that is walkable to everything you might need - make this place a gem!!!"
12937,616985297,The room was very comfortable and close to two subway stations.  Good local eateries and markets were also nearby.  It was very close to the tourist locations.
12937,618719862,"We absolutely loved Orestes’s place and will happily stay there again! Beautiful home, sparkling spacious room & bath, and so easy to zip over to Manhattan, not to mention all the nearby eateries like LIC Market, LIC corner cafe, grocery & more. So quiet and comfortable, it was a true retreat and restful stay in the city."
12937,671049756,"Orestes’s place is absolutely beautiful and will happily stay there again! Gorgeous home, great spacious room, and a large modern bathroom. Orestes was very personable and was willing to accommodate our requests. We contacted Orestes with less than 48 hours before our visit and he came through for us and then some. Cannot recommend him more strongly."
12937,700438990,"This place is amazing, never want to stay anywhere else while visiting NYC.

The place is amazing, better than the pictures (that shower!), the location is impossible to beat and Orestes is an amazing host.

I would 110% recommend this place for an amazing NY experience."
12937,750602402,"Famtastic and lovely place , wonderful host "
12940,613725213,"Adreinne’s place is great. Literally across the street from the train- groceries, coffee, bars, and restaurants all right around the corner. Adreinne is super sweet and has gone out of her way to help and got a new fridge in a single day when the old one stopped working. The apartment is spacious, very stylishly decorated and well equipped. I highly recommend staying here."
12940,654911622,"I had a great experience at Adreinne’s place. The apartment was clean and quiet and has beautiful art to enjoy all over the walls. The communication before and during my stay was excellent. Adreinne lives in the building and was always quick to respond to any questions I had during my stay. For anyone arriving with heavy bags or who may have mobility challenges, I would note that this is a third floor walk-up with three sets of stairs total up to the apartment."
12940,715752874,"Great space, amazing (Website hidden by Airbnb) was our home for four months, and it truly felt like home.  Terrific subway access, attached grocery is convenient and incredibly well stocked.  Even during Covid our NY stay was pleasant and memorable."
12940,719195168,"Fantastic place! Couldn’t get over how spacious it is for so central in Brooklyn. Adored the gorgeous art and the bed is incredibly comfy! Warning that it’s a lot of stairs if you have heavy luggage. Either way, would highly recommend and will be back for my next trip to Brooklyn."
13394,619881473,"Alex goes above & beyond with making sure your stay is as comfortable and easy as can be. Helpful and welcoming, Alex offers the best home away from home experience. I absolutely recommend his Airbnb for position, value and comfort."
13808,599589815,"JT and Tiziana's place is very strategically located - around the corner is the station for the C train to Manhattan. Walking distance to a big supermarket Food Town, Walgreens pharmacy, laundromat, food take-outs, cafes and bars, delis and convenient stores and several shops.  If you need  Urgent Care clinics and dental clinics there are several nearby.  The room we had was quite big and the plus is:  the bathroom is for your exclusive use. You get to use their kitchen. You get your privacy at their place. JT and Tiziana are such gracious hosts as they are very welcoming and helpful with our questions and needs."
13808,637396547,"Tiziana and JT were amazing hosts and have a beautiful home! The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated, it’s a hidden gem in an already lovely neighborhood. Thanks again!"
14290,596062185,"The best airbnb I have ever stayed in, in any city. I hope I get to stay here again soon. Favorite neighborhood in New York, full of artists and street art and great restaurants, right near the train to the city. And the loft has wide open space, a projector, a nice bedroom, workdesk, etc. Staying there feels like being brooklyn royalty."
14290,599991945,"James' space is my favorite place in New York. Perfect neighborhood, but so lovey I found myself just staying in a lot. Fantastic loft, hope to stay there again in the future."
14290,604191433,"This is my second stay at James’ place and I absolutely loved it, again. 
There is certainly something magical about his loft, that even 4th floor walk up does not scare off:) The style is so homey, yet relaxed and incredibly inviting. There is everything you need yet absolutely no clutter. Bedding is soft, ceilings are high, light is beautiful all day long.
The location can’t be beat either! So many cool eateries and coffee shops, plus a whole lot of cool boutiques all within short walking distance.
The heaters worked amazingly well for such large space and I was very comfortable and happy. Hope to return again!"
14290,608099101,"What an amazing space!! I miss it already and it’s exactly the kind of spot I would want to own in NY. It’s spacious, it’s bright, the bedroom was also awesome with super comfortable bed & bedding, it was comfortably warm throughout considering it’s February & it’s in an up & coming location with lots of gems in the neighborhood (amazing coffee shop, Sey coffee, just a 5 minute walk away) along with lunch & dinner spots. 

WiFi was fast & never dropped unlike some Airbnb’s that I’ve had trouble with. Privacy was on point & I never felt unsafe while there.

Note that the unit is in the 4th floor with no elevators. Wasn’t bothersome for me but might be for others. Typical NY walk-up though. 

I’m actually going to be booking this unit again as I’ll be back to NY again soon."
14290,626522952,"James' loft is the best place in Brooklyn, hands down. Best neighborhood, wide open beautiful loft. It's the dream people talk about when they think about a brooklyn loft. I ended up there during quarantine, and James was incredible during a challenging situation. It's a beautiful safe haven where you can spend time inside and be happy, while the neighborhood outside is the best in New York, with good food and art. I recommend this space as strongly as possible. Incredible. I honestly feel so lucky to have stayed there."
14290,650543358,"James's loft in East Williamsburg is an amazing space perfect for 2 people or 2 couples with a bedroom and a separate loft space. James is a photographer and his creative sense is well-represented in his thoughtful, stylish, quirky furnishings and decorations. Fun, artful, and beautiful details abound such as 

The dramatic photos should give you a sense of how much space there is! The loft features very high ceilings, around 12 feet, huge windows facing both east and west for incredible natural light in the morning and afternoon.

The common spaces include a kitchen, dining area, and living room with two couches, two leather armchairs, and a huge white backdrop that doubles as a projector wall for night time video watching with James's bright HD projector. As a note, we stayed in the heart of the New York's hot and humid summer and the loft does not have central air conditioning, so it gets hot inside. You can open the screened windows wide and there are two big portable fans to circulate the air. Given the age of the building, the size of the windows, it may also get chilly in the winter. There are built-in heaters in the bedroom and common area that we, summer visitors, understandably, never tried.

There is a well-appointed kitchen with a dining table for 6 diners, and a large commercial kitchen counter for prep work. We stayed for two weeks and cooked regularly using the pots, pans, gas stove, oven, microwave, and refrigerator. There is a drip coffee maker, but we used the French press for our caffeine needs.

The bedroom is completely enclosed and is the only space with air-conditioning. Since its a small window unit, it does cool the bedroom, but it isn't able to cool the rest of the space. The loft does have much less headroom, someone tall will need to duck to move around. There is plenty of space to hang your clothes, store them in dressers and shelves, store your luggage.

Under the loft is the office and the bathroom. The office features an old-fashioned office desk and chair, paired with decent 20Mb downstream Wifi connection. Ideal for working in the day, streaming videos at night.

The loft is on the 4th and top floor of an old industrial building which gives it much of its unique character, charm, and a dramatic view of its Brooklyn surroundings. However, there is no elevator and the floors are tall (enabling loft spaces) meaning you will have to carry all your luggage up and down 4 extra high floors. I am fit and was winded by the time I reached the fourth floor. If you not comfortable climbing stairs, this space may not be right for you.

The building is perfectly located between the JMZ and L trains in a lively Brooklyn neighborhood. It's a great base to explore Brooklyn and Manhattan. It is easy walking distance to coffee shops, grocers, and restaurants. World renown Roberta's Pizza is two blocks away. Subways stations are under 10 minutes walk away can take you to central Williamsburg, East Village, Bowery, Downtown, Midtown, and anywhere you want to go on Manhattan.

If you're looking for a Brooklyn adventure, I would whole-heartedly recommend James's beautiful loft."
14290,654833375,Great place to stay if you really want to have a real New York experience. Makes you feel right at home.
14290,661122087,"So homey and full of life, it was a wonderful place to stay!"
14290,664337334,"The photos don’t do justice to how big and beautiful this loft is.  & I couldn’t have asked for a better location in Brooklyn.

I was disappointed that I couldn’t use the projector (it wouldn’t work) or the rooftop (some man told me I wasn’t allowed).

Note that it is a fourth floor walk-up, and there is only air conditioning in the main bedroom.

But I would definitely stay here again."
14290,672389327,"Great location, coffee shops on varet are both really good."
14290,673388282,Absolutely loved the space. Better than the pictures. Beautiful morning light. Peaceful and a nice walk to Williamsburg and alot of cute places. Cozy and modern and would definitely stay again! Best part of my trip for sure.
14290,706738929,"A perfect NYC Brooklyn loft ! Had a great stay , Thanks James"
14290,707827577,"It is my 4th or 5th stay at James' place and I just love it! The loft is beautiful, full of great light at all hours of the day, very welcoming and has a great vibe. The location is awesome, walk everywhere and safe. I am used to the walk up, but it's not for the unfit:) I hope to stay here again and again, thank you so much for your hospitality!"
14290,711658635,"The place was very spacious, clean and cozy. The loft was also in a good location. Only issues: we couldn't get the projector or oven to work properly, which was inconvenient. Also, reached about said issue and never heard back. FYI Be prepared for the 4 story walk up. Might be a good idea to pack light."
14290,716465491,Great location and beautiful loft! It was a bit dusty but very well furnished and lots of natural sunlight throughout the day.
14290,722758455,It was an incredible space to stay for our vacation! We had a whole photo shoot at the Airbnb because the decor was so amazing. The host was super responsive and easy to work with.
14314,590086532,"It was such a great stay! Thanks for hosting us, looking forward to come back to that place when we will be in NYC again."
14314,607201117,"Nice place, affordable, hosts we very nice to work with"
14314,618013460,Amazing hospitality! I really enjoyed New York and staying at her place made the experience even more better.
14314,652175318,We had a lovely stay in Brooklyn! This location was perfect for us for exploring Greenpoint. The apartment is decorated so cozy and has everything needed for a longer stay (though we only stayed a few days). Would definitely recommend for a weekend or longer getaway! Our host was also very communicative and flexible with some last minute schedule changes. Thank you again for a great stay!
15341,700445627,Great location! Comfortable home and the best Air bnb host and hostess ever!
15385,586197644,Fantastic stay with Cristina. Amazingly clean and great location!!
15385,602680098,"Cristina was super helpful and great to be around, the area  is great and near two different subway lines :) would definitely recommend"
15711,589100308,Great place!
15711,598056479,"Great value on the UES.  Check in was easy, and the place was really nice!"
15711,609232062,Perfect location! You will feel at home! They answer very quickly to your questions
15711,613204390,"We had a great, quick weekend stay at D's place.  It was very convenient to the places we had on our agenda for the weekend.  The apartment worked great for our family, and the beds were really comfortable.  We would definitely stay here again!"
15711,635924247,Perfect for what we needed.  Jumping off place for visiting the sites of Manhattan.  Lot's of outdoor dining options nearby.  City bike dock two blocks away and Central Park 15 minute walk.
15711,712344895,"D’s place is great and as pictured in the reviews. Only downside is 5 flights of stairs, so get ready for some workouts!"
16326,589086378,We had a great stay with our family over the 2019 holiday season.  Very relaxing and a nice Brooklyn neighborhood for walks and yummie food choices. We all loved every minute! Thanks Dimitri!
16326,632536792,Its been a perfect stay. Dimitri is super helpful. The place is even better than the photos. Its been only positive stay and what a treasure to have discovered.
16326,702544018,Dimitri has one of the most beautiful gems in Brooklyn Ny.  Stay here you will not regret it.
16326,719469767,"We spent 9 weeks at Dimitri's place (late October through December 2020). We thoroughly enjoyed our stay! Dimitri himself could not be more gracious and helpful as host. He lives upstairs (3rd floor) and his family lives on 1st floor. They are all musicians but very respectful of quiet hours. The location, security and condition of this 2nd floor apartment is OUTSTANDING, especially for anyone staying in the Prospect Heights/Park Slope area. Easy walk to scenic outdoor areas like Prospect Park and the Botanic Garden (reservation-only during pandemic). In healthier times, there will be dozens of great restaurants, bars, stores and city parks nearby too. Check-in was seamless, with Dimitri willing to help however needed. If you have a car, the fireplug out front provides a great short-term unloading zone. Street parking is competitive; we rented space in one of many nearby garages. Nice sitting area at front of building, shrub-lined with gate for privacy. This section of Underhill Avenue seems very quiet, with low pedestrian traffic (and almost everyone wears a mask). Apartment is quite large by Brooklyn standards, and window-filled for lots of light. It has an open living-dining-kitchen area, wood floors with area rugs (NO SHOES policy), huge master with en suite full bathroom, 2nd full bathroom off hallway, large 2nd bedroom and 2 smaller bedrooms which could also be used as office space. Each bedroom has a ""reach-in"" closet for storage. Kitchen has good cabinet space, 4-burner gas stove/oven, full frig, dishwasher, and many nice cooking/dining supplies. Kitchen and both baths have lots of granite (latter with tub/shower combos). No washer/dryer (for our longer stay, Dimitri provided clean linens+towels every 2 weeks). Nice TV with DVD; has usual ""goosey"" DISH-TV (think host may change this soon). Great WIFI coverage and central heating. Every apartment has a door-buzzer system, so all deliveries can be left in 1st floor entry hall to allow NO CONTACT access. Everyone onsite follows Dr Fauci's advice-- wearing masks, social distancing and minimizing contact to protect each other. Dimitri's  apartment made it possible for us  senior citizens to feel safe and snug amidst resurging pestilence, a fall heat wave, 2 snow storms and that ever-present ""COVID cabin fever"". We definitely would recommend this apartment to our family and friends!"
16338,621537484,Nice spacious room in a good apt in an amazing neighborhood. It has what you need and is a great value for the area. Patricia is super nice and will go out of her way to accomodate your stay.
16338,735219566,"Light and airy, in a really nice and quiet part of Fort Greene/Clinton Hill. The deck is really nice. Patricia is a wonderful and accommodating host, always happy to help. Thanks!"
16595,586277655,"Daniel was an excellent host - very attentive, quick to respond, and accommodating. He made our stay in NYC better than expected and we had a wonderful new years week in his very comfortable and absolutely stunning home! It was spotless, exactly like the pictures, and in an amazing location. We're all very grateful to have had the opportunity to stay there and would definitely stay again - highly recommend Daniel and his Williamsburg abode!"
16595,595517693,The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
16595,634567393,Absolutely stunning home !
16595,635725986,"As pictured, a beautiful space in Williamsburg. A lot of natural light, large windows, and interesting decoration to puzzle over. Host was communicative and accomodating."
16595,637799115,Had a great time! Hopefully will come back again soon!
16595,638204266,Great spot in Williamsburg area! Host was helpful when I couldn’t locate check in key.
16595,652226324,Fantastic stay at Daniel’s place! The vintage furniture and projector set up made for a truly special experience.
16595,653208116,"Amazing place, cannot recommend enough. Daniel was super responsive and welcoming, a wonderful host hands down."
16595,660614145,"Daniel’s loft is truly beautiful and so thoughtfully crafted for space, function, and style. We had no issues because of how well organized the stay was! We really enjoyed dinner on the fire escape, using the projector, and marveling at the record wall. Great location, too. Close to great food and coffee and the river!"
16595,663304776,"Beautiful place that's exactly like the photos, you be glad you picked this place!"
16595,663889007,"A great, cool spot in a wonderful location!"
16595,665726961,Special place in a great location with super responsive and helpful host. A gem!
16595,666420344,"The apartment was in a good location and was really beautiful- so I have a hard time giving a three star review. However, I stayed here for one night (approximately 12 hrs) and paid a lot of money for the stay. With that said- the reason for the 3 stars- there were little notes everywhere- don’t touch this, don’t sit on this, put this here.. etc etc. it made me feel really uncomfortable. I felt like a toddler afraid to touch anything or leave something out of place. Also, there are strict rules posted everywhere- put trash here, compost here, plastic there. Put towels here, use this for this etc. etc. if I’m cleaning everything in the house, why the extra $80 cleaning fee? The only thing I wanted was a cup of coffee for the morning- and didn’t see any anywhere. Also- don’t bring a car- parking is non existent. And the neighbors (one lady specifically) was watching us- actually staring and making me very uncomfortable as we were trying to unlock the door. And three flights up- don’t bring a lot of luggage- it’s a haul up the narrow stairs."
16595,668137104,As you see in the pictures is what you get.
16595,669144796,"Daniel was prompt to respond. The place was charming and even better than I thought it would be. The location is very convenient to numerous points of interests, restaurants, and grocery stores. I’d recommend to anyone."
16595,700957286,"I had a great stay and would highly recommend staying here especially in a fall season, October is nice weather in NY.  It’s in orthodox neighborhoods, calm and safe area in brooklyn, very close to manhattan.  The room is very clean and has a good vibes with many antiques furnitures plus sunlight/wind from the window.  Just feels good just to be in this space having a coffee or beer.  Many thanks : )"
16595,716885864,"Beautiful space, very clean, great location, cordial and attentive host. Can’t ask for much more. 
(Bring a laptop with HDMI for projector!)"
16595,721023848,"Couldn’t have been more happy with our stay. Daniel was immediately responsive and incredibly helpful in working out issues we were having with booking. The apartment is even better than the pictures. Immaculately clean, decorated to perfection, and much more spacious than we had anticipated. Daniel responded to all of our questions within minutes and made sure our stay was fantastic. Cannot stress enough how amazing this apartment is."
16595,723014456,"All around a good setting to both start and end your day around Williamsburg. Incredible morning light, and a romantic evening vibe. Awesome place!"
16595,729656361,Gorgeous place in a great neighborhood with a wonderful host. Highly recommended.
16595,737933411,Such a stunning space. Danimbel’s attention to detail is immaculate. A very inspiring home with so much soul! Perfect stay!
16595,739006566,I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. It’s a beautifully curated space that is impeccably maintained. I definitely recommend staying here if you get the chance!
16595,741031095,"Ariel’s place is extremely stylish and comfortable. Unique, artistic touches everywhere. Spacious, clean, wonderful exposure. A short walk to groceries, cafes, a terrific running park, and all the fun of Williamsburg."
16595,743067919,"Definitely an amazing apartment, very intricate and so unique!"
16595,749968668,"Ariel’s loft was everything advertised and more. The space couldn’t be more perfectly decorated and quaint. Amazing location, the communication was prompt and the amenities were great."
16595,751919609,"Wonderful stay. The location was perfect to me as it was 10-15 minutes away from the busy North streets and less than 5 minutes away from citibike, the park, and a 24-hr deli. I personally prefer the quieter area. 

The apartment itself was so charming and well decorated. You can tell the host put so much thought into the apartment. Anything you were looking for is right where you expect it to be! It was clean and bright. The ~*vibes*~ were immaculate, especially when the sun is setting. 

There's a great cafe nearby Social House that had AMAZING service and delicious drinks and sandwiches. There is also an artisnal bakery, La Bicyclette, not far from from the location that was also wonderful. Williamsburg Music Center for live jazz on Fridays/Saturday nights at 9 is about 10 minutes walk. I mean all in all, great experience!"
16595,756679638,Amazing place! Beautiful decoration and super clean. The location is great - quiet enough to relax after a day in the city and close to many restaurants and bars. Thank you Ariel for sharing your place and for being an amazing host.
16821,586151312,You can’t beat Casey’s location. Right in the thick of it and perfect for a few nights stay. The apartment is cool and the bedroom cozy. It can be a little loud from the street but completely tolerable for NYC. Casey himself is super nice and accommodating. Enjoyed my stay overall.
16821,642298127,"Excellent location, heart of East village . Apartment is stylish, a combination of modern and vintage design, with a lot of retro touches, especially in the kitchen equipment and furniture. Great backyard. Real NY feel"
16821,655458493,"I stayed at Casey’s for over a month, I’m not from NYC but if you want the full experience you should stay here. Sitting on the fire exit & the rooftop access make the stay like its out of a fairy tail. 

Plus his apartment could be a museum, it’s full of quirky artifacts & city memorabilia.  It makes you feel like you’re truly in the heart of Manhattan."
16821,743592933,"I loved staying at Casey’s place. The location was much better than I expected: a lot of interesting things to do walking distance, there’s a subway station not far away, you can even walk to Williamsburg if you cross the bridge that’s very close to the apt. The space was amazing, full of art and very cool atmosphere. Casey was very helpful and he even showed me some places around, truly  local tips; I really appreciated that! He told me I could use everything I needed and I felt like home. I had a great time and I would definitely would recommend staying here."
16821,754292619,Great!
16974,615212713,"Our stay in this flat was perfect. The location is perfect. May be we should say, the sleepingrooms are all open without doors and no ceiling. 
The flat is really big.
We enjoyed our stay."
16974,706923931,"First and foremost, Robin is a gracious, thoughtful, and communicative host; the spacious loft is filled with natural light and plenty of room to relax and cook. Looking forward to rebooking!"
16974,708015661,"Robin and George were just the best! My girlfriends and I had a great time at their gorgeous loft. The rooms were spacious, clean and they had plenty of amenities. The area was fun and the street they live on is very quiet."
16974,728086566,"This loft is huge! And sunny! It is vey well equipped with kitchen items, towels, bedding, local info and so forth. Between the many great local restaurants and the markets around the corner, eating was a joy. It’s close to two subway stations so getting around is easy. And it’s a quick walk to Columbia and the west side parks. The hosts were responsive, helpful, organized and responsible. A really great visit. I highly recommend."
16974,731711530,I must tell you this place was mind blown. First and foremost I thank God for blessing Robin and George with the idea of opening their home to the world. I had an Airbnb cancel with me last min and prior to that Robin was in constant communication with me. She even accepted me in last min. I promise you will not regret the amazing hospitality you will receive from Robin. It’s at a great location with many shops just walk-in distance. If you have a car there are several garages nearby. The one on 120th and Park Ave was very close to the apartment. You will not regret staying here and I highly recommend choosing Robins place!
16974,740576324,"Everything is as advertised, nice spacious clean loft. And to top it all off the neighborhood is quiet and the foot traffic is very limited not only due to Covid but because your the only resident in the whole building besides the hosts who only come to visit. Just about everything is right next door and if it isn't you can always take the subway."
16974,744098364,Robins place was clean and fresh. All the amenities were accurate. All the basics and a few extras to make your stay easier were there.  I would recommend her place.
17037,614901285,"I had such a wonderful stay at Anna's apt. It's a wonderfully quirky space in an awesome neighbourhood. Anna was so helpful and welcoming, on hand for any questions I had. I highly recommend for a stay!"
17037,619682857,"We really enjoyed our stay at Charlotte's. 
She went out of her way to make us feel comfortable and provide us with everything we could possibly need. 
Her apartment has a lot of personality, and we enjoyed every little detail.

Thank you Charlotte!"
17747,586248201,George and Emily are extremely kind and prepared folk. They have great tips about where to eat and what to do in Brooklyn.
17747,615858959,"The entire flat, including the room, is clean and well-maintained. George is friendly and courteous, and was very accommodating when I was delayed checking in. The view from the back window is lovely, taking in Brooklyn streets and the towers of Midtown, including the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings.

The entry area of the building is undergoing some renovation or remodeling, so it's a little daunting when you first step inside, but the flat itself is very nice."
18195,624933383,"So lucky to find this place! Really love this apartment, everything is perfect. Justin is a great host, roommate, and friend. An ideal place for long-stay."
18195,744362982,"Justin is a great host, very easy to talk to, quick response. Gave us a great tour of the neighborhood , the room was just as pictured and Clean !! Would stay here again"
18198,623429193,"Everything was perfect and as described.  Safe neighborhood, Very clean appartement, comfortable bed, spacious bedroom, excellent location and a super nice host that made sure I had everything i need during my stay. Definitely coming back to justin’s place in my next trip to NY"
18198,665732806,"Though my partner and I could not complete our trip up to New York City, Justin was a very communicative host and contacted us frequently to check up on us and accommodate our ever-changing dates! I'm quite sad we missed out on what looks like an awesome apartment, but Justin seems to be a great host who takes care of his guests!"
18198,722406308,Justin is a thoughtful Host
18728,611330827,An absolute gem in the heart of a super cool area. David and Rick were warm and welcoming and the space is fantastic. Thoroughly recommend.
18728,616412697,"This was my second time staying at David and Rick's. It is the most perfect location I can imagine in Manhattan. So convenient to public transportation, and the West Village is my favorite district in New York. The guest space is very private and quiet -- great for sleeping. David and Rick helped me up and down the stairs with my bags (I have a bad leg), and that was great."
19159,623441905,Sybilla is very responsive And accommodating. Her place is very nice.
19159,644704056,Sybilla and her mother Nicoletta are very special people. Wonderful apartment too.
19159,659430288,"2nd time staying with Sybilla, highly recommend"
20717,592240356,"Had a really lovely stay at Guillaume’s place. It was very easy to reach him, he was very kind and accommodating for us and our check in and check our times. The location was really close to plenty of restaurants and shops, and it was very clean, stylish, and spacious. I would def recommend staying here if you’re looking to be in the area."

20717,597403406,"This is an absolutely beautiful home, spacious, quiet, sparkling clean.  It can accommodate, I think, 3-4 guest, and there is a well-appointed kitchen in the lower level easy for guests to use.  I had a bedroom facing the back garden and with its own bathroom, luxurious bed, and it was so deliciously quiet for a sound night's sleep.  Guillaume is the most congenial, accommodating host, who checks in to make sure you are comfortable and offers very pleasant, interesting conversation, while a separate entrance makes it very easy for you to come and go.  The location cannot be beat.  It was a real treat to stay here.  Next time I hope to get more time to chat over tea with Guillaume."

20717,603749612,"Good location for Prospect Park, right next to underground station and in an okay area. Rooms do not have locks, but does have a hook to keep the door shut for while you are in the room. The bed was a little hard if you have any back issues, but was clean. Being an old brownstone house you need to be respectable with noises as the walls are thin. Also the shower was hot, but had little pressure, but that isn't unexpected with old properties. I would come back to Guillaume's beautiful home, as the cost was good for the stay. Thanks Guillaume!"

Dana was so kind and helpful, quick to respond to any issues we had. I would definitely recommend this for any solo traveler or couple without too many items."

25696,586092736,"Absolutely loved Dena! She was kind and very communicative as well as considerate. She would communicate options for me to take routes, leave umbrellas for us, and always be responsive. There were a bit too many rules that we would sometimes forget(we were on vacation and could not remember everything.) Had to take shoes off, keep everything clean. Understandable though and she's upfront with her rules as well. My issue was that for the price, it was not as accommodating as I wished. I couldn't find the glasses to drink water, me and my boyfriend had to wait for a very long time for the roommate and her boyfriend to leave the bathroom even though we woke up extra early. My boyfriend had to put his contacts on in the kitchen sink and I held my pee for like 2 hours! Very inconsiderate since we were guests and for the price we pay. They knew we were waiting since we kept checking to see if they were done. Also one night, we were awoken by them fighting outside which I understand sometimes happens but was a bit disturbing. Overall its a nice room to stay and I loved playing with the cats! Just wished I got more for the price."

I couldn't find the glasses to drink water, me and my boyfriend had to wait for a very long time for the roommate and her boyfriend to leave the bathroom even though we woke up extra early. My boyfriend had to put his contacts on in the kitchen sink and I held my pee for like 2 hours! Very inconsiderate since we were guests and for the price we pay. They knew we were waiting since we kept checking to see if they were done. Also one night, we were awoken by them fighting outside which I understand sometimes happens but was a bit disturbing. Overall its a nice room to stay and I loved playing with the cats! Just wished I got more for the price."
26362,587105168,"Luiz's place is exactly as described in the ad. It is an amazing location and I felt safe returning late at night after being out enjoying the city.
If you are looking for a clean and safe space to stay, this is it. The room has a nice bed and a wardrobe to hang clothing. There is a nice TV in the room (not that I used that in NYC) but it is available. It was very nice to have  a fridge to put drinks in that I brought from home to save on the cost of purchasing water bottles in NYC.
Please read the information carefully. You have to be willing to accept a very small toilet outside of the apartment. It was not an issue for me at all because I was prepared for that upfront. I took advice from other guest and brought flip flops for easy use of the toilet during the middle of the night if I needed it.
I would definitely stay at Luiz's place again."

26362,593622984,"I had a great stay at Luiz' apartment. I only needed somewhere to sleep and shower for two nights, and I wanted an authentic traditional local experience, not a corporate hotel. I was not disappointed. On this occasion I had the apartment to myself so I did not see the other bedroom. But although it was compact the apartment was clean, and the building and neighbourhood seemed safe, even after midnight walking back from the Madison Square Garden area. If you think that vintage and compact is for you, I recommend this apartment."

26362,751926224,"Perfect for the price. Great location, I was able to make it anywhere I wanted to go and back easily. The bedroom was clean and comfy, there was a heater and a tv with netflix on it ☆, the shower was a little confusing at first, hard to get to the right temperature but I managed. Sometimes I didn't know if I was home alone or not which was a little weird, I felt like I was inconveniencing the person that (lives there?) but other than that, everything was absolutely perfect! he even let me stay a few hours later because my bus was delayed! Would definetly come again."

26785,623557293,"My fiance and I stayed at Dani's 2nd floor for a period of 2 months. She lives downstairs with her family so communication with her on any matter was seamless. The apartment is very cozy with a spacious kitchen. All the amenities necessary for our stay were provided by Dani. She happens to be one of the earlier hosts in Brooklyn and all her experience speaks to that fact. The area makes this listing special. Park slope has plenty to offer including Prospect Park less than 10 minutes walk and the F and G similarly close. If you happen to drive as we did, side parking is relatively easy relatively speaking. I would highly recommend anyone to spend a short or long stay at Dani's, you will not be disappointed!"

26969,705399922,"Our family (my wife, my 1-year-old daughter and I) spent two months in the house.

The good:
* Amazing location (5-10 minutes from several parks, tens of cafés & restaurants, 1 minute from the subway)
* Charming back yard
* Plenty of toys for kids of all ages
* Great communication & easy check-in / check-out

The bad:
* The house is pretty dark
* Constant long line of people in front of the house (waiting for UPS and/or CityMD) 
* Floor is very creaky (our daughter would wake up every time someone walked nearby)
* Old furniture, some of it with bad smell
* Kitchen is not equipped enough for long stays
* Lots of noise from the outside, especially during the weekends. Some days we would have to endure 3-4 hours of electronic music from nearby parties."

29013,599570211,"Angela is an amazing person. She always communicated within the hour I sent her a message (usually within seconds) and was always available to answer any questions I had. The check in was smooth and easy, and even when I showed up an hour before the agreed time, she still was there and greeted me warmly. She also offered me a room that became available, twice the size that I had booked, for the same price. She also is extremely respectful of everyone’s personal belongings when she comes once a week to clean. Also, she comes once a week to clean! That is the first time I’ve seen such considerate and clean service offered on a monthly Airbnb stay. The bathroom, kitchen, and room were all extremely clean and well stocked with anything I could need. The neighborhood is the perfect location, you feel like your in a calm and quiet neighborhood, but you are 2 blocks from the subway and tons of restaurants/bars/gyms/stores. I definitely recommend Angela’s place, for effective communication, stellar location, high level of cleanliness, and hospitality that goes above and beyond."

29628,599291288,"Jitsu is an awesome company! I will miss him Chris's pale ale is my favorite beer, no need to go to a bar, he has everything!"
29628,604782476,"One of the best Airbnb hosts I’ve encountered!

A few highlights:
- Chris is super kind and friendly. Made the entire stay comfortable and gave good local tips. Engaging conversations and you can tell he cares about making your stay comfortable. 
- location is fantastic- subway stop is at the corner of the street. 
- the room is as described and large! the entire place is very clean including bathroom. 
- his dog is the sweetest and beautiful. 

Highly recommend and would stay there again in the future!"
29628,607195173,"Chris really is a super host. The place is ideally located, right off the metro, with more things than you can think to try in the immediate surrounding streets, the Brooklyn museum and botanical garden just a short walk away as well. You'll enjoy meeting Chris and Jitsu as well. 
I stayed here with my partner and we couldn't recommend this place more strongly. We will be staying here again for sure."
29628,700193544,"Chris' place was as expected from all the reviews!  He was thoughtful and considerate of our needs.  He was willing to help us with anything we needed and made delicious restaurant recommendations!  He would chat as often or as little as we wanted.  His kitchen is stocked with all the tools needed to cook basically anything.  The place is clean!  The location was perfect; less than a block from the C train and two blocks from the G.  Grocery store/deli/restaurants within walking distance (he's blocks from the BEST burger in NYC).  Jitsu (his dog!) is adorable; he stays out of your room unless you invite him in.  All in all, it was super easy to stay with Chris for a month.  We definitely felt at home.  He's a professional host to be sure."
29628,746064613,Absolutely amazing stay and it’s been the best Airbnb experience I’ve had!! Chris truly lives up to the Super Host name and is Extremely kind & thoughtful and has as an amazing and very clean space. Will be sure to come back!
29628,748242140,"Amazing host that replies super fast to your messages, questions and provides great recommendations as to what to do, where to visit and to eat (delicious places, thanks again Chris!). The place is at a great location, good neighborhood, very well connected with public transportation and not far from the Brooklyn bridge. Jitsu, the amazing and lovable Shiba Inu is the sweetest dog we've met and of course, he is well trained and respects your room. I definitely recommend Chris's place!"
29683,595136616,"We had an amazing stay at Uli’s.

The space is comfortable and cozy for down time after a long day walking around nyc. 
Would recommend and definitely stay again!"
29683,597452835,"Uli's flat is stylish, comfortable and in a great location. If you have the chance to stay here you would be silly to look elsewhere."
29683,600319694,"The location is great, you are near Soho and the subway to go anywhere easily.
Check-in was very simple
However photos are a little bit old so you see that the apartment has a few more years.
A slight downside is that you have a few homeless people down the street due to a soup kitchen I guess."
29683,602662393,"The location is fantastic - close walking distance to all the restaurants we wanted to try - Katz's Deli, Emily's, Ippudo, pizza by the slice joints, great bars, also a couple of CVS pharmacies nearby. Also close to subway stations - very easy to get around. The apartment was clean and well kept. Uli was a great host, and very communicative, quick to respond to messages, and provided helpful information prior to our trip. The only drawback is the check-in and check-out process, which requires you to pick up the keys at a nearby business from a self-serve, electronic key storage box. An extra step and a potential complication if arriving late or tight on time to catch your return flight. Overall, I'd recommend the apartment but plan accordingly and give yourself some extra time for check in and check out in case you experience any issues with the key service as we did upon checking out."
29683,605881205,Very nice place: stylish and minimalistic. Good neighborhood.

29683,618779987,"Uli’s place is really nice decorated and clean, as shown in the pictures.
He was flexible as we had our flights delayed and let us stayed few hours more to not stay in the street with ours luggages, i recommand!"
29683,622473820,"My stay overall was very peaceful. I booked here to have a quiet place to hunker down in for a couple weeks. The kitchen was fully-equipped and the location was right by plenty of grocery stores. The space is very chic and warm. Uli was a very responsive host, and answered all my questions in little to no time."
29683,624825586,"If you read some of my other reviews, you'll notice that my husband and I have been chronic stay-cationers in NYC, preferring to explore different neighborhoods when we do have the luxury of staying together sporadically. Out of all the Airbnbs that we've had the pleasure of inhabiting, Uli's place was our definite favorite thus far.   First off, as you can see from the photos, the apartment is impeccably decorated, with some very tongue-in-cheek artwork that I'm a huge fan of. The kitchen is fully furnished with high-end labels, and for a month-long stay, we made good use of the calphalon cookware :) There's multiple routes for the coffee-addicted (as we are), in the form of a Nespresso machine, a French press, or an Italian moka pot. And if your preference is to have someone else make your coffee, I highly recommend Lazy Llama, just a short minute's walk down the block.

Prior to check-in, Uli was communicative and ensured that any worries we had about the cleaning and hiccups with check-in were taken care of, and we were able to very easily access KeyCafe to pick up our keys.  During the entire stay, we stayed in touch and he never took more than a few hours to respond.

We are slightly biased because this is our favorite neighborhood, but there's nothing quite like escaping for a walk through Thompkins Square Park, a short jog to the East River promenade, or across the Williamsburg Bridge. Lastly, and most importantly, I was working from home during my stay, and the internet was incredibly reliable for my multiple conference calls and long work days."
29683,627473751,"nicely designed, well-equipped apartment with an excellent location. one of my best stays in NYC so far."
29683,630369412,Uli has a uniquely decorated place in a very desirable part of town. I stayed in his apartment while the city was still recovering from Covid 19 and it felt safe.
29683,635006282,Great location and excellent space! Thanks to Uli for a nice stay.

29683,664637453,"Bright stylish apartment in a perfect and very convenient location - close to many restaurants, coffee shops and Whole Foods. Perfect for the real Manhattan experience. The apartment was more spacious than anticipated and it was easy to work from the desk in the bedroom. Check-in and check-out were done remotely and the whole process was very easy. Uli was very easy to communicate with. Would absolutely recommend."
29683,668640766,"Amazing neighborhood. Everything you could need is a short walk away. Easy access to Citibikes, and public transport. Amazing food and drink options within a 5 min walk. 

Check in process is really a lot more simple than the directions make them seem.

lit with good amenities and located in one of the most sought after areas in Manhattan - West Village. The Hudson River Park is a couple blocks away and is the perfect place to get your morning workout routine in. Groceries, cafes, eateries, international cuisines are a stone’s throwaway.

Tom is an amazing host and has been very responsive and helpful through the period of my stay! 
Highly recommend the place.

Thank you,

31994,606582709,Cozy space in very convenient location in Clinton Hill!
31994,610011714,"Although this is a nice house in a great location, there were several problems with check-in and other guests staying in the house.
The host is never actually there, his sister, who was very nice and tried to be accommodating, is in the house.
Unfortunately, it was never communicated to her who was actually staying in what room and consequently it took forever for my room to be prepared.
That brings me to my next point, I was never made aware that other people were staying in the house. Based on what I was told it was my understanding that just his sister was in the house and I would be renting a private room and bath in another section of a house.
The guest in the room next to me was incredibly loud and noisy, and given the fact that there are wood floors with no carpeting in an old Brownstone, it is incredibly noisy. Also they were singing or humming all night, banging on walls, and their phone was going off all night.
And I hope you like cats that meow all night.
It wasn't until 4 or 5 in the morning when things finally got quiet. And by then I had had enough, got ready and just went to the airport. 
And that was five hours before my flight left, I just wanted to get out of there.
It's a nice room, but the mattress is very uncomfortable, the hot water is very temperamental, and unfortunately it was too cold to take advantage of the deck outside the room.
I think a lot of these issues could have been avoided had things been communicated more clearly.
It would be nice if you could communicate with the host by phone, rather than sending several messages.
And unfortunately this ghost host never communicated clearly with his sister who was staying there and what rooms they were in.
And although you can lock the room from inside, the host never gave his sister a key to lock the door on the rooms when you leave the house. There is absolutely no privacy when you leave the room. Anyone could have had access to it.
To summarize, it's a nice house in a great neighborhood, but lack of communicating all the particulars led to a miserable stay."

This place is very spacious and includes a beautiful private bathroom. Everything was extremely clean, fresh and inviting. This space is located in a prime location and is a blessing to find in Brooklyn, NY during these times. Stay safe. Invest in yourself and enjoy your stay. It is well worth it."
31994,650974925,"Very nice place, Waldenar was great"
31994,652196717,"Waldemar is a very friendly host & the space provided is beautiful, private & comfortable. Would recommend to anyone looking for a stay in BK."
31994,657887433,"Booked this room for a staycation with my boyfriend. It's in a great location, the attached balcony and extremely nice bathroom definitely make the room. This is a good place to book for a few quiet nights of relaxation. Keep in mind you're staying in someone else's house so there is another room right next to yours. The walls are definitely thin! Also keep in mind the air conditioner is only on after 9PM so it does get quite hot in the room during the day. The room was clean and Waldemar was a responsive host."
31994,661668537,"Nice, bright and spacious room. Cleanliness, small patio to enjoy"
31994,664729561,"He has his sister staying there with you, so if your looking to book a spot where your going to be alone this is not the one"
31994,668789887,Listing is accurate. Clean and a fine place. The room and house creeks everytime someone walks. Not sure the price reflects the total value of the place. Dont have anything negative to say but not much positive either.
31994,704278653,I love your space. Definitely will be returning. Hopefully soon
31994,725245420,"Recommend this place , not perfect but very nice."
31994,752422641,"Great place to stay in Brooklyn. Close to the subway, great eats, and shopping."
32037,586253612,Sahr has been a fantastic host to our daughter and friend.
32037,603615106,A wonderful place to sleep in the city that never sleeps! + Amazing host.
33009,605513353,"Another perfect stay at one of our favorite Airbnb accommodations in the world. 

We keep coming back nearly every year for more!

Thanks as always Ming - the apartment is looking nicer every time we come :)"
33009,608061764,"We stayed at Ming's for 5 nights and it really was a good experience. The appartement is very well located, 1 bloc away from the lively Bedford street's bars, shops and restaurants but in a calmer area, which was important for us after the daily exhausting marathons all around the city. Acces to Manhattan is easy and convenient with either L or M line. The appartement itself is very clean, pretty large and tastefully  decorated. It had all amenities required, although we actually didn't used it much. Ming quickly and accurately answered to all questions we had. The only bad point was the klanking pipes and radiators in the bedroom every morning at around 6am when the heat starts. It was hard for us jetlacked visitors to fall asleep again but eventually forced us to wake up and go out. Thank you again Ming"
33009,672979574,Highly recommend this apartment!
33009,705945582,"Great location, thoughtfully decorated, fast wifi."
33009,710268024,"Ming’s Airbnb is a lovely place, perfectly situated on a quiet street and close to so many great restaurants, bakeries, and public transportation. I was impressed by the tasteful details, modern amenities, and cleanliness throughout the space. The bedroom is quiet and cozy, and the kitchen is packed with great equipment to make cooking very enjoyable. Beyond all this, Ming is an expert host, very responsive and accommodating. I really enjoyed my stay. Thank you!"
33009,729236544,"We loved staying at Ming’s place! My husband and I worked from there for two weeks, and the home was great for that.
The apartment is cozy, comfortable, clean, charming and practical. It has high ceilings and plenty of light. It’s also located in a prime spot in Williamsburg.
Ming herself is warm, welcoming and quick to reply. 
She left special touches in the apartment for us like fruit, flowers and tea. 
She even ordered a desk for the bedroom as I mentioned I would like one to work on! So thoughtful."
33009,747980787,"Ming's home was lovely, clean, and in a convenient location. There were thoughtful touches in the apartment and she was very responsive to our needs. We had a great time and felt very at home!"
33009,756183717,"This is the perfect apartment for a one or two person stay in Williamsburg. The apartment is spotless, equipped with everything you need, and 5-10 minutes walk from anything you might want. I couldn’t have been more comfortable and would stay again in a heartbeat."
33156,700420918,"A lovely place to enjoy New York life; Quiet apartment for writing and study; close to Central Park and several supermarkets, and most importantly, super nice host!"
36703,614586495,"I’ve stayed in this beautiful, sunny apartment for 2 months (Jan-March) and my stay was incredible. The apartment is in an amazing location in West Village near great amenities, shops, bars, restaurants with great public transport. I was there during the winter and the apartment is warm and cozy. Karene has been the best host. She is friendly and attentive. She was super quick in answering my calls and texts and she went out of her way many times to make my stay as comfortable and easy as possible. I’d highly recommend staying here."
39282,595681980,"Convenient, comfortable, cosy - Gus and Holly were wonderfully respectful hosts who gave me a wide berth of personal space (important for introverted travellers!) and offered great tips and advice when asked. Short walking distance to the metro connecting to everywhere else in NYC. Look no further!"
39282,599287444,"Awesome place, with a great location.  Close to bars/restaurants and such, but most importantly the metro.  Easy access to the city.  Gus and Holly were friendly and helpful. Great hosts, highly recommended."
39282,601788903,Great stay in a great area. Close to everything and very safe neighbourhood.  Holly and Gus are very nice and relaxed guys.
39282,611264148,"Staying here was a pleasure. The space was clean, stylish, and in a great location. I highly recommend staying with Gus. Thanks!"
39282,615774293,"Perfect little place to access manhatten. The L train is a few minutes walk, and the ride to 14th st is about 10-15 mins.   Place was very clean, and the hosts were very friendly, and offered the use of a well outfitted kitchen, and use of the common living room.
Bathroom and shower were clean and pleasant to use.
Holly even invited me to attend a little get together they had one nite that i was there.
For value  i dont think you can beat it."
39282,638747203,"Cool place in a nice thriving neighborhood. Welcoming and friendly hosts. Easy checkin.
Highly recommended."
39282,660633095,"The room is clean, has great views. The location is very good for the deal, and the hosts are amazing!"
39282,705457711,"Everything is absolutely accurate in the description and I would recommend the place without reservation. Gus and Holly are indeed a very laid back couple that are both respectful of your privacy but also friendly and conversational. They made me feel at home and I'm sure they'll make you feel welcome too.

The room and apartment were clean, well decorated, and had a better than expected supply of kitchen equipment. Additionally, the apartment has tall ceilings, plenty of sunlight, and even a dedicated area to workout with an available and legit pull-up bar. 

The apartment covers the entire top floor of a multi-story building in Williamsburg and as described there's easy access to the roof -- which offers a fantastic view of the surrounding Williamsburg. It was charming to hangout out and enjoy a meal with friends up there as the sun set in the distance...

If you want to go somewhere, there are multiple subway lines within easy walking distance. 

For people who may be interested:
- The outside traffic can get a little loud at night but nothing overly excessive. 
- Being the top floor of a 3 story walk-up, expect to climb some stairs on a fairly regular basis...But don't worry, you get used to it and then feel like a champ in no time.  ;)"
39282,709058993,"Beautifully decorated house. Has all the essentials you'd need such as coffee, cooking pans and pots, spices, umbrellas, etc. I worked out of this room for a week, and WiFi worked fine for video meetings and calls!  Holly is very quick to respond and helpful, and the other roomates are also easy to live with. Only thing is there is not an elevator, so if you have a lot of suitcases like I did, bringing them up and down can be quite a workout. Thanks for the great stay!"
39282,712296414,"Awesome stay that's:
- Super close to the L train 
- In an awesome neighborhood with lots of amenities
- Beautiful and well-thought out
- Hosted by really sweet people

Stay here if you're genuinely trying to feel ""away from home."""
39282,721529703,"The best kind of people. Kind hearted, caring, wonderful humans. An absolute delight"
39282,728408984,"I stayed/worked from home at Holly’s for over 20 days and I’m really happy I chose her place. She was a phenomenal host, I felt very safe and comfortable. I especially loved the coffee/espresso setup and the big windows/natural light the loft gets. Holly is quick to respond and very friendly. The location is obviously very central and close to some great restaurants and the train. Highly recommend!"
39282,741769622,"Clean room and thoughtful touches in this Brooklyn apartment, I worked from here for a week no issues, enjoyed the stay bed comfy. Close to subway, ended up visiting city few times, used kitchen few times very well stocked"
39282,743529668,"Gus and Holly’s home is everything I could have asked for and more! They’re home is very welcoming and beautifully decorated! Also it’s in PRIME location for you to venture around Brooklyn or neighboring boroughs either by foot or public transportation. Lovely neighborhood, amazing vibe and sooo many options for entertainment be it restaurants, bars, museums, boutiques... etc. 20/10 I would stay at Gus and Holly’s home again!"
39586,749868027,Such a nice stay. Corina was so nice talking to us telling us what’s around. The room was big the bathroom was clean. It’s a great deal in a comfy safe place. I would totally recommend if you need a place in the city!
42300,732861475,"The loft is really good, the outside view is a big plus. The house instructions are extremely accurate would recommend it a 100%"
42729,586303196,"It’s a bit rough round the edges but is a good-sized space close to the subway, restaurants, bars, and coffee shops. It is in dire need of a deep clean however. The public entrance hall/stairwell did not smell good and was messy. The apt, while the sheets and floor were clean, felt dusty and over-crowded with old furniture and cushions and blankets that I’m sure were once ok but are now just dust-traps. The towels felt clean but smelled terrible and need to be washed with bleach at a high heat, or preferably replaced. There wasn’t adequate bedding for the second bedroom which is especially cold as it has two outer-walls. There was no smoke or carbon monoxide detector in the apt or in the hallway outside it, just blank spaces where they used to be. There is also no control over heat. It was mostly warm but one evening the heat went off randomly and it was chilly. As other reviews have stated, the second bedroom is only accessible through the main bedroom which was fine for us, but possibly not for everyone."
43726,603631486,Great location within walking distance to fabulous food and sight seeing. Cozy and stylish space to spend time together during a girls trip. Would stay again.
43726,618102254,Evette was extremely communicative throughout the whole process. Great location - would book again.
43726,702129172,"Extremely well-situated stylish apartment in Tribeca. Whole Foods is a few blocks away, many great restaurants are as well. Excellent spot for anyone who enjoys running or cycling, as it is a stone's throw from the water where there are bike paths and lots of outdoor activities on the piers."
43726,719479015,"We loved being able to spend the holidays with our three daughters who live in New York. The five of us slept comfortably there and we made good use of the wonderful kitchen. The view is absolutely incredible and the neighborhood is very safe with lots of restaurants,  and grocery and drug stores. The subway is close by and very convenient to get anywhere in the city. We would highly recommend this fantastic apartment."
44229,604503695,My second stay here since I loved it so much first time round. Excellent room with excellent location and local amenities.
44288,602673650,"Sara's unit could not have been at a better location. I stayed at Sara's place for about 2 weeks for work travel and this was the best decision. The neighborhood is safe with a plethora of eating options and cafes around. The space is clean with a decent cooking range, microwave, refrigerator and anything you need for a long term stay. I had an issue with check-in since I thought it was self check in but it isn't, however, Sara was able to address the situation promptly and was also very responsive the entire time. WIll definitely come back!"
44288,629928560,"Incredible place. If you’re thinking about staying here, do it! Very comfy studio, comfortable bed, and nice little view and ambience of west village in a classic manhattan building. Peaceful and safe. If you work at home, you can get a lot of work done here. Or if you are out and about, nice place to relax at night and nice neighborhood to wake up in and take strolls. Tons of bars, cafes,  restaurants and stores nearby. Also super close to the water if you enjoy going on runs. Sara was an amazing host and communication was great. Can’t recommend this place enough."
44288,714084021,Sara is a wonderful host. Her apartment is in an excellent location and the building is safe and convenient with an elevator for convenience. The apartment is cozy and the perfect thing for a couple or a solo traveler.
44973,586310447,"Had such a great stay at Anastasia’s place. Check in process was super easy, apartment is really spacious, I was expecting much smaller based on reviews and knowing NY hotel room sizes. Location wise is great you can jump on the metro easily into Manhattan and the streets nearby have so many bars and restaurants. Anastasia was always easy to get a hold of if we needed anything. Great stay!!"
45556,587140805,We had a wonderful time staying at Doug’s! His place is beautiful and exceptionally clean. He gave us plenty of amazing recommendations and tips about the area and was always very friendly and accommodating. I would love to stay here again.
45556,616776961,"Super convenient place - great location, comfy bed, clean space and Doug was great to deal with !"

45556,632266046,My stay here was very relaxing and enjoyable. I recommend it.
45556,672979732,"One of the most professional and personable Airbnb hosts I’ve ever met! Doug was great, and his home is perfectly situated in the best neighborhood in Brooklyn. Clear and reasonable house guidelines, clean and organized home, very comfortable bed. i wouldn’t have changed a thing and would happily return! Thanks Doug!"
45556,711291024,"Doug's space is super nice and cozy, in a fantastic area with everything you could need or want within a few minutes walk.... transportation, food, fun, and just an all-around delightful neighborhood.  Doug is super nice and helpful and made sure I settled in co.fortavly and had everything I needed.  Great stay all around."
45556,721340611,Nice place to live for a short trip! Doug is enthusiastic and helpful and will provide all you need. Room is not very large but enough for a single man. It is safe and quiet around. A good choice for a short trip in New York!
45556,744112791,Great location
45556,744619417,"Doug’s place is just as advertised, quiet, comfortable with a great location in Ft. Greene. Doug is a gracious and welcoming host. Highly recommended."
45556,753068319,"My Dad needed a place to stay momentarily after I had an accident and I booked Doug’s room, below is his review:

Doug’s room was perfect! The location was right by Fort Greene park and public transportation that took my daughter and I where we needed to go. Doug was happy to share his knowledge of the area with me. Overall, the space was very quiet, clean and comfortable. Will definitely come back again!"
45556,755388908,Great stay!
45556,756729540,"We had the privilege of staying at Doug’s place for two nights ! Doug has a warm and inviting personality that we loved. His place was clean, comfortable and very quiet, especially for Brooklyn. The neighborhood is great with lots of wonderful eateries and shopping nearby. Doug was very responsive on any questions that we had and helped us find things that we needed. We will definitely be back again ! Thanks for everything:)"
45936,604315829,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
45936,614262469,"I enjoyed staying at Raul's very much.  If you want to get a feel for academic as well as apartment life in New York, it is a perfect place and location.  Rahul is a relaxed and flexible host."
50447,587750024,Amazing experience! Thank you a Laurie.
50447,622740429,"Best host I have ever had by miles. Usually I don't even see or speak to my hosts other than basic info, but Laurie was extremely helpful in finding good food, directions, even subway help and info about the area. She even stocked the amazing kitchen with organic and very high quality coffee, eggs, bread, deli spreads and bagels which was so helpful as I was a first responder for the Covid crisis and had been worried about food. She shattered any previous standard I had had for an Airbnb host, and the apartment was on the same level. Can't wait to go back for a non-working vacation"
50447,624522987,"Laurie’s place is an overall wonderful, unique experience. The location near prospect park is fabulous, within walking distance to the park. Laurie’s is close to many markets, shops, and restaurants. The area around the home is upscale and safe. The place itself is clean, homey, eclectic. The kitchen is perfect size and has all the amenities you need. Having laundry right there to use is extremely convenient. The bedrooms are large and beds are comfortable. The bathroom is clean and a nice size. The back patio with a garden is STUNNING! There are very few downsides to the place, one being no television. (No big deal in comparison to all the wonderful aspects of this place.) 
Overall, my stay at Laurie’s included comfortable quarters, fantastic location, functional amenities and PHENOMENAL hospitality. I would stay again and I highly recommended!"
50447,626521445,"Laurie's apt is perfect for those wanted to stay in the quiet neighborhood of Park Slope (South Slope). It is a cute neighborhood and you have access to her amazing backyard garden. She also provides you with plenty of delicious food for breakfast including croissants, eggs, yogurt and jam. It was the perfect Brooklyn escape for us."
50447,631523434,"Laurie is an outstanding host that will go out of her way to go above and beyond for your comfort and experience. Very quiet space that is very befitting for writers and book worms or if you just like peace. If you want a perfect Brooklyn getaway whilst forgetting you’re in the city, look no further. Here it is before you :)"
50447,646401035,"Great place to stay, Laurie was an awesome host.   She is very close to many restaurants and close to the park.  I will stay again,  great experience."

50447,669357519,"What a nice surprise to arrive to such a lovely, spacious garden apartment in Park Slope.   The apartment is quite private, with its own entrance, full kitchen, and comfy bed. My host, the lovely Laurie, packed the fridge with fresh foods, such as yogurt, fresh squeezed orange juice, and bagels.  Of course there are pots, pans, dishes and staples. Access to a washer and dryer is a terrific bonus for a Brooklyn apartment.  Situated in a convenient neighborhood near restaurants, pharmacy, and transportation, this home features gardens in both the front and back yards and is situated on a quiet, treesy street.  You'll find classic art on the walls and plenty of books.  Enjoy!"
50447,702109265,Good location and a very helpful host.
50447,708027588,Laurie was very kind and quick to respond. She gave my daughter and I some great recommendations on places to eat the night I arrived. I had a great visit to Brooklyn and will for sure be back.
50447,716292062,Laurie was a great host and was very attentive to all of our needs. She wanted to make sure our stay was as if we were living in our own home and everything was taken care of.  She really went above and beyond.  I will defiantly be staying there again.
50447,720113483,"Laurie’s garden apartment is the perfect location in South Slope, near the subway and commerce but on a nice quiet block. It’s a great bonus to have the backyard, and it’s an ideal setup for Covid times because you’ve got a private entrance and are not sharing hallways with anyone. The space is suited for a couple, close friends, or small family. Our daughter loved the library of kids books. We appreciated that it feels like someone’s home and not a hotel. We didn’t get to meet Laurie but enjoyed communicating with her and had no trouble checking in. Hope to stay here again!"
50447,731268624,"Really nice and cozy. Kitchen was stocked with cooking and serving wares.  It was great because I stayed with my girlfriend and we like to cook. Nice little thoughtful additions like teas and coffee. Laurie is so friendly. Great location, close to the park."

54544,587768271,Stayed for two nights. Great place and location. Close to subway. Wayne’s very responsive. Easy check in.  I would stay there again for sure.
54860,617007105,Amazing! The room and private bathroom are clean and comfortable. Ted is an amazing host. He gave us a lot of advices about subway and restaurants and also prepared a great breakfast every morning. The little kitchen supplies helped a lot. It's super near the subway station and a short 13 minute walk to Central Park. Would definitely stay there again.
56859,608399962,Great place for staying. Highly recommend.
56859,626544437,It’s very nice and beautiful.
57166,603773578,"My husband and I just sold our apartment in Queens. Our new home was not ready so we needed a place to stay for a month. Vasili is an exceptional host. We arrived, with many bags, to a warm, beautifully decorated apartment, hungry and tired we happily found a delicious cranberry loaf and comfortable bed. The apartment is fully equipped, all you need is your toothbrush. We felt like we never left home. We spent many days exploring Astoria, great ethnic shopping and restaurants, all within a few blocks. It was difficult to leave at the end of our stay. Thank you again Vasili for the bakery treats and your  hospitality!  Beth & Ben"
57166,607244704,The space was very clean and Vasili was very accommodating and quick to respond to any questions I had.
57166,639473783,"Our daughter's family lives in Astoria, and we are on the left coast, so we have rented many airbnb's over the years. This is my favorite. Three main reasons: 1. Space! Rare to find a spacious, open floor, see photo. We had a picnic with grandkids in the yard. Granted, not fancy, but just what you need and at a good price.  2. Location. Happens to be close to our family, but also, all the great restaurants and bakeries. Astoria is looking pretty festive, despite Covid. People are good about wearing masks. Way to go New York. Lots of outdoor seating. And 3: Vasili and Beatrix. So nice and super helpful."
57166,645822381,"This is a great property with all that Astoria has to offer within walking distance. Everything that is offered is what you actually get. The artistic decorating flair, new bathroom, kitchen, and clean space make it even better than I expected. The host is wonderful and accessible, prompt communication."
57166,669659380,"Wonderful hospitality, ideal location, nice updated apartment with outdoor space! Quiet and safe. We can't wait to stay here again!"
57166,737441028,"The place was wonderful clean and spacious , it also had a backyard which was pretty cool .lots of fresh towels. The host was amazing with communication.He’s a very cool understanding person and I appreciate the pie .I would Deff recommend to anyone to stay here , its a cool place to relax at . If your a smoker like my fiancé was just step a good distance away from the windows to be respectful it doesn’t not get in the home and go through the windows some people may have asthma and Ofcourse don’t want smoke in there home , even though this happen he kindly just told him to close the second door . Very cool guy !!!The bed was super comfyyyyy I ddnt want to get out of bed . Try staying here guys!!

Thanks"
57166,739388237,"If you are over six feet tall this place is not a great idea because sections of the ceiling are a bit low.  Also be aware the kitchen space is really small. But otherwise, in general an interesting space nicely done."
57166,743171728,We really like this place and hosts are super nice.
57166,745388149,Great location and easy communication
57166,747981067,"This AirBNB is one of the nicest NYC stays we've had. It is extremely clean and supplied with everything you need. The kitchen is small, but the living space -- living room and dining area -- are unusually spacious. The apartment is on a busy street but is shielded from noise so it is very quiet. We will definitely come here again."
57166,748663312,Definitely a hidden Gem in Astoria ! In a great neighborhood and not too far away from attractions and very close to food ! My son loved how much space he had in the home . We felt right at home ! Will definitely stay again !
57166,752385216,Location was great. Living room was large albeit low ceilings. Access to backyard is lovely on a nice day. Mattress was firm and bed frame was very noisy.

57618,607200661,We had a great stay! It’s in a great location in Hell’s Kitchen and the description was very accurate.  Thank you Ana!
57618,671870073,"Ana's place is in an incredible location and has everything you need! There is an elevator. That's right, a WORKING elevator! I have trudged my suitcases up many a NY walk-up so this is an incredible perk. Great living space with a large bed. Ana's a prompt and clear communicator who shared fantastic tips about the area and her recommendations. Loved our stay here!"
57618,704843482,"Amazing beautifully decorated apartment in nice safe Area, high ceiling, big windows, one bedroom, very clean, nice comfy bed, comfy pillows, I even want to buy the same mattress topper for my own bed. This is Anas place, she lives there, she just put aside her personal belongings and all apartment become yours, nice kitchen with all the equipment if you want to cook, Tv with Netflix  . Ana is very kind, accommodative and responsive to your needs, if you have any problems or questions she responds right away, by text or calling back. I had a lot of fears and questions because of traveling during covid , Ana was very patient , understanding and attentive to all my needs ."
57618,714291276,Ana’s place is very cozy and the area is great. Really loved how close it was to stores and how easy it is to get delivery here even late at night! We also asked for an earlier check in since we had remote meetings for work and Ana was able to accommodate! Super grateful for helping us with that.
57618,750064049,"Ana was a excellent host. I was in New York with my daughter for her birthday. Ana made our NYC experience a great one, she pretty much planned my visit with all the information she shared. If there is a such thing as a Air bhb host award  Ana be in the race!!! Her was very clean, everything was as list. location, location, location, and I did for to mention the location. everything u need is within walking distance."
57754,587048600,"R’s place was spotlessly clean and so spacious (rare in NYC!). The location was awesome too, we could walk to many restaurants, bars and amenities easily. 

R was also responsive and helpful during our stay and we are truly appreciative of that. 

Given that we were there for the NYE week, her place was an oasis of calm for us, away from the crazy crowds and traffic. It really felt like a home away from home. 

And the icing on the cake was Edith the cat, the sweet and adorable flatmate who hung out with us and was no trouble at all. We thoroughly enjoyed the catsitting gig. 

If we could give 6 stars to R’s place, we would. Definitely will stay here again if we are back in NYC."
57754,596703565,Great apartment with an excellent host. Absolutely nothing but good things to say. Edith is very friendly as well.
57754,659914174,Beautiful apartment and great location. Perfect place to spend a few days - would book again!
57754,664625908,"Rachel’s place was a jam! She is a wonderful hosts and her cat, Edith, is a lovely little girl :) The place is stylish, very artistic and unique. It seemed to be much more spacious than on the pictures. The location is great: there is a Madison Park by the Flat Iron building 3 minutes away and plenty of restaurants around. I loved everything about my stay and I definitely recommend it!"
57754,672361367,"TL;DR: Amazing place, great location and a very sweet cat.

Fleeing from fires in California, we stayed and worked from R's place for few days. 
- Location: Great location. Everything is within couple of minutes of walking. Even during COVID where a lot of places are closed. 
- Space: Quite a big and roomy loft for Manhattan. R is an artist and you can see the that in the decoration. 
- Work From Home: The internet worked pretty well and there is accessible power plugs everywhere.  One person can also take calls in bedroom and not bother the other person working in living area.
- Bedroom: The black-out and double windows in bedroom makes you forget that you are in a big city. 
- The Cat: She is an amazingly sweet and friendly and calm cat. Truly made our stay a better experience than we thought we would have."
57754,702070948,"Beautiful space.
Great light. 
Great location.  
Sweetest cat.  
Definitely no cat smell. 
Lovely host."

And Edith (the cat) is nice and friendly, she likes a lot to sleep on my orange sweatshirt. The washer and the dryer right inches apartment. Kitchen is also surprisingly big and well equipped. Definitely recommended to stay."
57754,726157288,Rachel couldn't have been more helpful or accommodating. Her apartment is a total winner and is now at the top of my NYC favourite's list! SO HAPPY we booked.
57754,729900513,"Beautiful homey spacious and perfectly located apartment with an elevator (!). Loved everything about it, the host very kind and generous and the kitty was a sweet finishing touch:) Hope to be back one day!"
57754,731667388,"Gorgeous loft in Manhattan, interesting decors, hundreds of books, wonderful piano, but best of all, Edith was an amazing cat that made my two nights very special. I would love to stay again for Edith!"
57754,737267975,"R is a wonderful person who went out of her way to help me when I had a glitch in my travel. She always answered me right away. The pictures show how beautiful her place is. For me, having a sweet kitty is part of a real home experience. Highly recommend."
57754,743195892,"I've been using Airbnb regularly for my career. I've stayed at so many different locations over the years, and I can hands down say that staying with Rachel was one of the best experiences I've ever had. I can not say enough good things about my stay. 

Rachel is beyond kind, welcoming, attentive, and more than happy to make sure you have everything you need for your stay. Her Airbnb is peaceful, tasteful, and spotlessly clean. Definitely an oasis to relax in and find a little bit of quiet in a bustling city. 

The Airbnb itself is very aesthetically pleasing, and has everything you'll need. It comes with soundproof windows in the bedroom, blackout shades, a very comfy kind sized bed to sleep on, lighting fast wifi, and every amenity you'll need while you're there. It's definitely not a place for a wild time, but more for having somewhere to relax and call home while you explore the city. It's also definitely the place to stay if you're an animal lover. Edith, Rachel's cat, is incredibly sweet. She was shy initially, but will warm up to you fast. 

I can not recommend Rachel's Airbnb enough. One of the best stays I've had in quite some time!"
57754,746102669,"Second time staying at this place. Amazing experience once again! The piano, Edith, all the amenities and the convenient location make this my favorite place to stay at in the city!"
57754,747845736,"We stayed at R’s for a romantic weekend staycation and OMG - where to begin! The space was perfectly clean and over-the-top in charm. The bedroom has soundproofed windows, which was largely appreciated and helped us actually relax. We also loved sharing the loft with the sweetest companion, Edith, who was the best behaved (and beyond loving) cat I’ve ever experienced. Would highly recommend staying here!"
57754,750386214,"A very special and unique apartment. It definitely has a soul! Rachel is a great host - very friendly, helpful and cooperative. Edith is very sweet and shy cat girl. By the way, there wasn't any smell of cat litter at all, so don't be afraid. I hope to stay at Rachel's apartment again!"
57754,754203440,"This was easily the best Air BnB I’ve ever stayed in. Gorgeous apartment, incredible location, and among many other positives, a very responsive and helpful host. I especially liked the baby grand piano and Edith the cat!"
57874,586102519,A very nice and clean place. Definitely worth the stay in NYC.
57874,593284791,"The apartment was immaculate, and Simon's array of snacks and refreshments made it so easy to feel relaxed and at home immediately, after the long flight.

The location was ideal for me, being off the main road but close enough to get to shops and the nearest subway entrance.

All-in-all it was a lovely place to stay and after a long day exploring it felt like I was coming home."
57874,601499083,Simon went out of his way to get some ballons for my wife for her 40th Bday! The spot was great‼️ we will be back‼️

57874,641106875,Great location
57874,645955042,"The apartment is located in Harlem on a nice and quiet block. Parking is limited but can be found and parking in the garage is reasonable. You may have to double park if you have a lot of luggage and the apartment is on the 3rd floor. As you walk to the top floor it may be very warm but once inside its like a breath of fresh air. Both air conditioners work very well and keep the apartment cool and comfortable. Its a perfect spacious apartment for 2 people, very clean and modern. Wifi and television worked great, never any issues."
57874,647734309,What a great find. I wanted a Harlem experience for my week of work in the city. This was perfect. Stylish. Clean. Would do again. Simon is very accommodating. Thank you!
57874,652835086,"I guess if ur not looking for much but a clean bed and spacey apartment good for a work trip . But doesn’t feel like home. No real aesthetic. Blankets, style etc. do not come for an amazing night sleep . But if your simple and need a good work space then this may be for you"
57874,660254187,I had such an awesome stay!  Thank you for your hospitality!
57874,666369838,Simons place was extremely clean and comfortable to stay in. It had all the amenities necessary and everything was as described. He was extremely helpful with letting me book last minute and very fast at responding to messages. Location was also pretty good as it is only about a 5 minute walk to nearby shops and the subway station. 10/10 would stay here again.
57874,671067824,"Lots of natural light, speedy comms, stylish apartment."
57874,673999113,"I had an awesome stay at the Brownstone apartment.  The space was located in a vibrant community, on a quiet residential street.  I was a woman traveling alone and I never felt unsafe in any way.  The apartment is really lovely, has a calm and stylish interior with all the amenities one would need.  I would definitely recommend this location and I would stay here again.  Thank you Simon!"
57874,704253912,Great experience.  Beautiful place.  Easy on street parking.  Prompt and  helpful communication.  Simple Check in and Check out. Wonderful location.  Couldn't ask for anything better.  Hope to stay there again some time.

57874,752654342,"Simon's place was absolutely beautiful. My partner and I felt very welcomed. Although we didn't get a chance to met in person he made is feel welcomed by the sweet treats left for us.  The location was perfect, right in the heart of Harlem. Whole foods was just a walk away. Great restaurants and shopping outlets. Parking was somewhat easy to find. Place was fully equipped with what we needed. I would definitely stay here again."
57874,755340564,"Simon’s Haven was immaculately clean, comfortable, spacious and cozy. Well appointed, it was exactly as pictured on the Airbnb website. I so enjoyed staying there.
It’s location was ideal for everything-transportation, restaurants, grocery stores, etc.
It’s a beautiful brownstone. The apartment is a walk up that is on the top floor. That was very hard for me because I am a senior who is a bit physically challenged.
Simon said that he also had a first floor apartment that I could have gotten which was unfortunately occupied at the time.
I would certainly book that first floor place if it’s available the next time I’m in NY."
58059,589735330,"So great! I can’t recommend Agnes’ place enough. She has been an incredible communicator from even prior to booking - she accommodated me when a flight got canceled and helped with the rebooking process down the road, helped with directions to get to her place, allowed for us to store our things, and my goodness the accommodations. Literally anything you could want or need, Agnes has thought of and has ready for you. The apartment is kept immaculately clean, and she was always available to answer questions and make sure our stay was going well. It’s only a 20 minute ride from midtown and close to the subway - only about a 3 minute walk. There’s plenty of food nearby, and the building is easy to find."
58059,590803654,It was awesome
58059,592212797,"Agnes’s place is one of the best value rooms in New York City- the room is large, and stocked up with all the little bits you forget when going on holiday! Agnes has a few house rules, but these ensure that the place stays in the great condition it is for yourself and future guests, and are very easy to comply with."

Agnes welcomed us at the check in and was available to share info and to help us when needed.
It was a nice stay."
58059,602666674,Agnes is an amazing host!
58059,605885786,Very nice room and the host did a wonderful job of communicating directions to the apartment.
58059,608371920,"Meticulously clean. Extra touches such as water and snacks in the room, toiletries provided, etc. were really nice. The area was quiet and felt safe. Very close to subway station and easy to get to lower Manhattan. Agnes was easy to contact and shared some history of the area with us on arrival, which I appreciated. This room in particular has a private half bath that is down the hall, but the full bath with shower is shared. We rarely had any issue with the full bath being occupied by other guests. We were out and about every day so we were only there late at night until morning, but overall it was a good experience and a great place to stay on Manhattan with great value. Would recommend."
58059,615236465,"Agnes is the best! She provides everything you need and then some, and you definitely feel safe and well taken care of. Beautiful Harlem location, around the corner from the subway. Highly recommended!"

58059,669099468,"This was our second time staying with Agnes. She’s a great host, very attentive, and communicative. Our only issue was that the bathroom near the room was not functioning for the first day and a half of the trip which was frustrating but she let us know right away and we were able to use the other bathroom. Other than that it was a very pleasant stay. Would definitely recommend staying at Agnes’ place."

On top of this, her apartment is very clean, quiet and comfortable. She does a phenomenal job of keeping it clean and checked in often to be sure I had everything I needed. She left soap, lotion, a toothbrush, water, and snacks in the room, too. Agnes really cares about her guests and goes extra miles for them!"

And the train station was around the corner. Totally perfect "
58062,606632276,"The listing does not mention the cat in this apartment! If you are allergic, this is not the place for you. The cat stays out of the room for the most part, but with cat hair in and around the common areas (and a bit in the room itself) this was not viable for me. I was displeased that this was not in the listing."

60680,590786261,"This “gem” needs a bit of polish.   The area and location are fantastic if you’re looking for the East Village experience, but at these prices, there are plenty of alternatives.  While  the layout is exactly what would be expected with an East Village apartment, the furnishings and decorations were wholly uninspired. The shower water pressure was strong and warm, so there’s that.  Also, the apartment is street facing, and so there is the expected morning noise of garbage trucks, etc."
60680,598650521,"I had a lovely stay at Mich’s place. Her apartment is very cozy and in a great neighborhood with everything you need and more (restaurants, markets, bars, etc. ) all within walking distance - you are close enough to all the action while still being able to sleep at night. 

Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the area!"
60680,609872507,"this spot has a welcoming, colorful and rustic vibe; located next to a park; steps away from a variety of great food and vibrant nightlife—you can’t go wrong staying here"
60680,614582710,A sweet apartment in a perfect location! What else can I say?
60680,618535237,"Mich was very easy to connect to - access was so easy and simple- the location is brilliant and close to anything you need - great coffee shop just down the road- the apartment is great size by NY standards and had everything I needed for my stay
Will definitely return - thank you"

60680,630561765,A truly great spot!
60680,657409833,"This was a great apartment, with an excellent location."

60680,706266631,"This is a great location, and the accommodations were more than  I expected.  The host was very available when I had questions, and responded very quickly."
60680,708725482,"Great spot! From location, to space, to feel. Highly recommend."
60680,710955005,"We had a great stay. Mich  was a supportive host. The neighborhood was nice. Being close to the park was fun. Nice farmers market there on Sunday. Starbucks close. Grocery close. You do hear the sounds of the city. Which I would expect. It is only one flight up so easier to walk up to than many NYC apartments. Thoughtful things at the apartment like a Water filter pitcher, plenty of hooks for coats and such. We only bought one meal out and the kitchen had what we needed to prepare all our food. Good shower pressure. The WiFi worked well for streaming."
62452,589685762,great place to stay!

62461,587849042,"Lisette is a very communicative host and also very helpful. As we asked for an early check in she let us in the apartment earlier. Even though the room we stayed in was a little dirty and there was just one bathroom for 4 rooms, we enjoyed this cheap deal."
62461,591152101,"Perfect location, check-in/out was super simple and easy"

62461,621456674,Great place to stay. Very quiet. Will not mind coming back. Thank you guys.
62461,624090217,"Lisette was very responsive whenever I had a question or needed help.

The weather was nice when I arrived so Lots of neighbors were out enjoying themselves. 

I drove to SI and was able to find street parking. Her place is close to buses, a beautiful park, SI hospital, and local stores in a very culturally diverse and lively neighborhood of Staten Island which I liked a lot. This is what I appreciated the most because it amplified the realness of everyday SI working class and not the “movie” type NYC like Manhattan. 

It’s a clean, convenient affordable room exactly as described. Minimal things in the room which I appreciated, good place to lay your head down after a long day of touring or working. I had no issues whatsoever with others who stayed there and would request another stay in the future."
62461,626552320,Perfect for a few days stay
62461,630816566,"Lovely, private room...nice housemates"
62461,633625333,"Comfortable, safe, housemates are neighborly"
62461,647362510,"Was a very calm, chill, place, and it was in a good location with a lot of methods of transportation, close to the city, charming room, only thing was the fridge in the room didn’t work so I had to use the fridge in the kitchen but the kitchen and room and bathroom was very clean and the host was very hospitable thank you guys!"
62787,587743890,"Super easy check in and clear communication the entire time. Quick to action issues during stay (change a lightbulb and supplying new hair dryer). As described, 20 minute walk to ferry with easy access to Manhattan. 

Unfortunately one of the other guests may have been smoking in the building which made it unpleasant to be in the kitchen, but that’s not the host’s fault. Not the best upkeep but good budget accommodation."
62787,594996886,Clean small rooms near ferry so that one could visit NYC.
62787,599925921,"This stay was exactly as described and a great value. My room and the common spaces were very clean. The bus, taking you to the ferry in maybe 10 minutes is a half a block away and passes very frequently. A hip local bar scene is within walking distance  If you’re looking for a tranquil spot near Manhattan with a limited budget you can’t go wrong with Lissette’s place"
62787,605090215,Great place to be
62787,607739915,"Like a hostel.  Great if your on a budget, and plan on spending your time in the city."
62787,612392709,Great stay for business or working
62787,622464261,Always enjoy my stay here. Thank you.
62787,626641646,"This is place is in a great location if you are staying in the area for awhile. I stayed for 6 weeks. There are lots of necessities close by, laundry mat, grocery store, family dollar etc. Beware this is not in the best neighborhood, but it was still a safe place to stay. 

Tip* Bring your own cleaning supplies for the bathroom. 

Often I found myself looking for cleaning supplies all over the house, even in other unoccupied areas so that I didn’t have to buy my own to clean up after others. The guest staying in other rooms were not clean at all, I felt like the maid. I wished they were more strict on cleaning rules. 

Some of the guest bring a lot of people in/out who gain access to common areas like the bathroom, and kitchen. It ended up feeling like a public bathroom, and many times some of my food in the kitchen went missing along with other items around the house. One girl a friend of a guest staying in the house, seemed to lerk around the building often. I Found her sleeping in bathroom and in the kitchen multiple times; like I said this is not in the best neighborhood. 

The house kind of has a Big Brother feel; they have cameras all over the house (not illegally ex. Bathroom) however didn’t seem to make my stay any better. 

Other than that the room is stylish, and the host are kind people. They offered me great discount, and were very accommodating when I was figuring out arrival and departure dates. For that I give them an A+ overall stay was a C."
62787,655569481,Exactly what I looking for.
62787,659073581,"Great communication, the room has everything you need and the bathroom is very clean"
62787,661614463,This place was a very good place.
62891,653497186,"Adorable little house with side garden. In the heart of Lower East (Website hidden by Airbnb) even has a soaking jetted in the larger then expected bathroom. 
The sky lights are so wonderful for natural light and even better to hear the rain at night. 
We will stay here again for sure!
Olivia and Carroll were terrific host."
62925,618640283,The space was truly unique and well thought out.  We had no issue getting around Brooklyn or into NYC.   The bed was very comfortable.  I would definitely stay here again.
62925,650989165,"Unique decor and great location. Maya was super responsive and flexible about our checkout, which we really appreciated.

The space is grr generally musty and dusty. AC is limited to the bedroom and washer/dryer wasn’t operating during our weeklong stay. Internet speed made video calls impossible, so would come prepared if you’re planning on working remotely."
62925,667793976,"Amazing space, in a perfectly quaint location in Greenpoint. The space is gorgeous. Best shower in all of NY! Highly recommend. Definitely worth it!!"
62925,731964165,Maya’s place is a Greenpoint gem! It is close to fun bars and restaurants on Franklin Ave and it’s a special experience staying in a historic townhouse. Maya was incredibly responsive to us throughout our stay and made sure we were comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and the bathtub is a wonder!!
62925,740569617,outstanding place. I felt like I was home. Maya is great! I'll be back.
62925,750016426,"Beautiful location and home! We stayed here for a week and we loved it. Maya was a wonderful host. She was very quick to respond to our questions. Unfortunately, the washer and dryer was broken that week."
62925,751266025,"We enjoyed our stay! Maya has a wonderful style and her home reflects that. The location in Greenpoint is unbeatable. You are close to everything and still tucked away down a quaint, quiet street. Maya responds to queries right away. Please pay attention to the house description as it is not appropriate for young children or people with mobility issues. There are no stair railings inside the home and you must use stairs to get to living areas. If you are a lover of esthetics with fun and funky style, then this is the place for you."
63320,586134946,Had a great stay here. Close to Staten Island ferry which gets you to Manhattan for free and offers a nice view of the skyline and Statue of Liberty.
63320,587875456,"Comfortable stay, great location & even better host. Highly recommend!"
63320,590083923,Great place! Very comfy
63320,605494631,Super cool Hosts / great value and location / excellent attention to detail!!! I look forward to visiting again!
63320,613765685,A very affordable nice stay. host was very kind with fast responds
63320,616406136,"I would stay here again, I was happy with the accommodations."
63320,622572011,The place is quiet and pleasant. You have a clean bathroom and a clean cafe/kitchen at your disposal.
63320,645918692,"Small room, not worth the price paid. They were doing upgrades as I was leaving, so it'll probably improve in the future."
63320,707151783,Great place convenient and great price
63610,587058132,Cozy & Comfortable
63610,633037877,"My stay at Vie's place was both enjoyable and pleasant. Not only was her location within 3 blocks of the train station to Manhattan and the rest of NYC, but she provided local tips, free coffee, comfortable bed, quick response to questions and even a discount due to booking her place during the Covid-19 pandemic so that I could visit family /friends while having my own privacy. I highly recommend that if you're visiting anywhere in NYC including lower Westchester that you stay with Violet aka Vie for her great hospitality."
63693,587746972,Difficult to see beyond New York being the world's greatest city and apartment provides a good base from which to explore it. Not that close to Midtown but 10 mins takes you to the subway. Nice pubs and restaurants within a very short walk. Apartment itself could do with updating and a good clean. Stairs not suitable for younger kids or anyone with mobility issues.
64107,587779974,"Book this spot if available! My boyfriend and I so enjoyed the hospitality and welcoming atmosphere that Niya created. First of all, this space is incredible. A Brooklyn brownstone in lovingly restored condition and the most incredible art and literature gracing the entire space make this place a knock-out. And the space is well-laid out for an enjoyable stay. Plus the neighborhood is great! So many awesome spots for all types of food. Also, the distance from the A-train is a huge plus to get to Manhattan quickly. A big thanks to Niya for the many reqs in the neighborhood! He was so kind when he greeted us with a tour of the space and amenities (including all of our questions about the amazing art), neighborhood recommendations,  as well as some New York tips for our stay and travels. 

We also enjoyed the details that Niya put into the space to be accommodating. Coming and going was a breeze, and with lots of good luck with the statue by the door. Niya also outfitted the space with a mini-fridge, electric kettle, microwave, and some utensils/dishes in case you need them. Ohh and I was worried about being cold because I'm a wimp in the cold, but the place was always comfortable and had extra blankets if needed. 

Again, we had such a great visit in this space and highly recommend it! And when you get here, take in the glory that is the bathroom 2-story gallery wall. It's incredible like all the other pieces throughout the space. Enjoy!"
64314,588396229,"Lovely place to stay in NYC. Great location, cossy and welcoming apartmet with amazing diamod inside - the Host Herself. Debbie is most welcoming and possitive person that we met during our travels. It was a great stay in NYC. 100% we will come back and stay at Debbie place."
64314,609270630,"Super Zen,
I felt like I was in my own private yoga studio while I stayed here.
Very comfortable and relaxing, also close to food and subways.

I highly reccomend!"
64837,595091032,"Edward's apartment is very well located. The price is very good for New York City and the room is comfortable. One thing to be noted is that during our stay the pipes made some noise at night.
We stayed there a week and could easily get to all the parts in New York we wanted to visit. 
We did not get to meet Edward but communication with him through the AirBnB messages was good."
65615,589730118,"Not much to say here :-) excellent flat, great hospitality and communication, every single little thing was on point. Just book it already."
65615,618610925,Great place. I stayed there over a month and felt very comfortable. Valerie was also a great host.
65615,660590561,Valerie’s home is conveniently located and very spacious for New York. It’s a perfect spot for a person or couple.
65660,587201793,"The apartment is cute and cozy; the bed is super comfy, and the space was clean.  We loved the location!  Close to several subway lines so it's easy to get to Manhattan for day trips, and there are so many cute bars and restaurants all within easy walking distance.  A great Brooklyn getaway!"
65660,596022939,"This place has the potential to be a great airbnb experience, so I will just make some observations for the host to take in consideration. I had a defective key for the building main entrance and had to wait for other people to open the door for me and was provided a key not exactly immediatly. After that, I can say the place isn’t exactly as the photos, it’s windows doesn’t have blinds or curtains as shown excepting the bedroom which makes the experience a little weird, and there is no tv as shown in photos although the description does say it doesn’t.
Besides this, everything else was okay."
65660,598095982,"Had a great stay at Larissa's place. The location is brilliant with loads of great local spots to eat and drink, plus it's a breeze to either take the nearby subway or walk over the Williamsburg bridge into the city. 

The apartment was exactly as advertised. It was clean, comfortable and check in and out was super easy via a lock box and Larissa was quick to respond and easy to communicate with. Highly recommended and great value given the location."
65660,605137181,Larissas place was very conveniently located to some great parts of Brooklyn as well as the subway. She was very helpful in answering all my questions before and during my stay. The location has great natural light and is perfect for a short trip while having the essentials you need
65660,610579048,"Our stay in larissa’s place was great - the apartment was very clean and is in a great location nearby subways, restaurants and stores within walking distance. Our only issue that we had occurred the day of our stay as we were told we had to pay an extra $20 a night after the first guest. Admittedly I happened to miss this detail clearly written in the additional prices area but I’ve never experienced this pricing for an Airbnb so it threw me off to receive a message day of check in that I owe an extra $70 after I already paid the reservation in full a month beforehand. It wasn’t a make or break deal, however, cause we were already en route to the city and the nightly rate was cheap and in a good location but she mentioned that this happens all the time so be sure to double check this factor when determining the pricing and comparing other apartments! Otherwise we had a great stay"
65660,612502864,"Larissa was very nice and super quick to answer any question or call. Her appartement is really well located in Williamsburg, close to shops and restaurants, and a short walk to quirky cool Greenpoint as well. The View on the Brooklyn roofs is nice and we could even see some of the Chrysler Building! We enjoyed staying there a lot. There’s a bodega so very convenient if you have forgotten to buy coffee! Many thanks Larissa :)"
65660,671857345,"The best. Larissa is personable, helpful, patient, friendly, and communicative. 10/10 person and host. She has made my stay far easier and more pleasant and stress-free than I could have hoped for: The space is homey, spacious, full of character, comfortable, and private but it an excellent location. 10/10"
66008,588478516,"Melissa’s apartment was immaculately clean and comfortable. Carroll Street stop is only minutes away, with a variety of excellent restaurants, wine shops, bars and coffee bars.
Because it was reveillon holiday, we did not met Melissa but the communication was ease.
The kitchen is the other great point. We had everything we need. Super organized.
As it is a 10 minute walk from our daughter's house, we will definitely be back soon. Thank you so much Melissa"
66008,597080176,"Perfect accommodations for a few days in NYC. Melissa was super responsive to all of our questions and the space was clean, comfortable and in a fantastic location."
66008,608373012,"The location of this apartment in a lovely area of Brooklyn was great!  Beautiful and quiet tree-lined street.  Very close to the Subway, which made it easy to get in and out of the city.  Great neighborhood with lots of cute shops and good restaurants nearby.  Nice little apartment perfect for 2 people or 2 people and a little one."
66008,609835763,"Top notch place to stay in the heart of Brooklyn.    Extremely clean , safe and quiet.   A true home away from home  that my hubby and I highly recommend to anyone visiting the area.   Melissa is truly a super host attentive to our every need.   Will definitely be returning.  "
66008,620424763,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  I arrived at Melissa's adorable garden apartment just 7 days before NYC was declared a coronavirus hotspot.  I was scheduled to stay at her place for a month while working on a dream job... and then my job was cancelled.  Melissa was very cooperative in dealing with Airbnb and making sure that we could cancel the reservation and that I could see a refund for the unused time.  I am very grateful.  The apartment has everything you need for a longer stay and is situated in the fantastic neighborhood of Carroll Gardens.  I wished I could have stayed longer!!!!  Best wishes and a million thanks to Melissa and her family."
66251,593621812,"Samir's place was amazing. Beautiful loft, great decoration, super spacious. Very central location. 
The keys are at a Cafe 3 blocks away which was very convenient since I got there in the middle of the night. 
Very responsive host. 
Overall great experience, would recommend and stay again if I go back."
66251,598661979,Lovely space in an excellent location! A comfy bed and a well-stocked kitchen made my stay extra nice. I will book again whenever I can!
66251,605430529,Samir has a great spot in the east village.    Super cool space and the piano was clutch.   The bar downstairs can get a little loud on the weekends but its the east village so kind of goes with the territory.   Would stay again.   Thanks Samir!
66251,613727609,"Samir’s place is perfectly located, super stylish and a music lovers paradise! I really enjoyed my 5 nights stay, there was plenty of local pubs and restaurants and was still within walking distance to the big Manhattan landmarks. Would love to stay again."
66251,614873581,"This was my second stay at Samir's place - so that alone is a testament. I found it so lovely the first time, I came back!"
66251,617629911,"Nice decor, a very interesting and well decorated apartment."
66251,634065572,"Amazing decoration, great location and a good valur for money! The house was clean overall but not up to the high standards. If you are looking for a sparkling clean, try somewhere else"
66251,647024891,"Great place right in the East Village. Close to everything. Bigger than it looks from the photos, and a really nice interior. Would recommend."
66251,656061770,"My stay at Samir's apartment was great. The photos match quite well, and besides some issues with the kitchen, it was a beautiful place to stay for a week. Location is great, decor was great, and I'd recommend it!"
66251,660594202,"Absolutely great location. Very nice space, well-appointed. Very comfortable bed. As noted, there’s some noise from outdoor bar below. We didn’t mind at all, but you will hear some festive talking, through closed windows in kitchen and bathroom. 
A bit disappointed that the patio was not usable from our perspective, with the boisterous crowd right there, and heavy smell from McDonald’s. But this was still an awesome place to stay, right in the heart of the east village, with a great kitchen/private laundry/comfortable sleeping location, and astoundingly quiet sleeping with great sealed windows even though right on very busy 1st ave. Highly recommended. And of course, that gorgeous piano that sadly only reminded me how much I’ve forgotten in 20 years since playing."
66251,669623904,"Samir's apartment is incredibly spacious for New York City, and in one of the best locations you could ask for with easy access to restaurants, bars, grocery stores, pharmacy, parks, and public transportation. We stayed here for 3 weeks, and it was a great spot from which we could explore the city. Samir was also very responsive and check-in was really simple, which is not always the case in NYC. The description also mentions street noise, but we didn't hear any of that in the apartment, which made sleeping that much easier.

We did have a few issues though. The bed is soft, which at first was great, but after a little while made our backs ache. There also wasn't much room to hang up our clothes, which is ok once again for a short stay, but for a longer stay made things more inconvenient. There were also some cleaning issues, some of which we resolved ourselves, and others which Samir helped us with, but would have loved to have not been an issue to begin with.

All in all, Samir's place is a great spot from which to explore NYC without having to compromise on space."
66251,672934952,A beautiful stay in a great location!
66251,702385234,"The key pick-up and drop-off point is a short walk away, so dealing with this process is OK in itself, but a bit inconvenient with Luggage (I had 2 large trunks on wheels. I'd prefer an electric lock or something more modern. 
The place itself is perfect, please keep it clean and thank you to Samir."
66251,717623328,10/10!! Loved staying here. Thanks Samir.
66251,724945292,This place is sexy. Comfortable. So much bigger than it seems in the pictures. Amazing  patio. The location is incredible. Samir responds immediately and was incredibly accommodating. The bar below has the friendliest bartenders around. The piano is stunning and kept in tune and sounds  incredible. No complaints. Absolutely loved my stay.
66251,743832014,"This is a HUGE studio by NYC standards.  The apartment has a great, stylish vibe and the location is perfect.  The East Village is a fun place to be and the apartment is a short walk to the subway.    If you get a chance I suggest you try out Monomono just steps aways on 4th street for some Korean\Asian Fusion dishes.  Please note that the apartment is above a bar on 1st Ave.  It was not noisy but we were here during Covid's 11:00PM curfew."
66251,745583854,"Samir’s place is great! The pictures do not do justice in my opinion. Great use of space with stylish touches. The location is also perfect and in the heart of east village, close to Washington square park as well. Overall, we had a very nice experience at Samir’s place."
66275,587734642,Tony was very responsive. The location was perfect along Bowery with walking distance from Little Italy and Chinatown. Tony offered excellent suggestions in the Lower East Side. Very clean space and welcoming.
66275,593006380,"Had to check in much later than expected, but Tony was super accommodating. Space was very clean and surprisingly quiet for NYC. He gave us lots of food recommendations and it felt more like staying with a friend vs a paid service. 

(FYI, his girlfriend also lives there but she is equally friendly, polite, and quiet!)"
66275,595025168,"By far one of the best hosts I’ve encountered on Airbnb! Tony is incredibly friendly and hospitable. He goes above and beyond to be welcoming, without ever coming across as intrusive. Communication with him was always speedy and consistent and he went through great lengths to make our visit a breeze. I 100% recommend Tony’s apartment due to his thoughtful and attentive nature as well as the terrific proximity to  major attractions.  At Tony’s we felt like we were staying with a good friend!"
66275,596385212,"From the beginning, Tony was a great host and very communicative. Check in was a breeze even though I arrived early. The location is excellent, especially if you spend a lot of time in Chinatown, Soho, LES and East Village. Grand station is a 30 second walk from the apartment and many restaurants and cafes and a short walk away. The apartment was clean and pretty quiet. Will definitely stay here again."
66275,598971304,"I would 110% recommend staying here. Not only is Tony a great host with lots of local tips but it’s an amazing location (not even a 1 min walk to the closest subway), was always clean and Tony is always looking out for you and making sure you feel at home even when you are so far away from it! I had a great time and if I ever return to nyc I’d definitely be staying here again. Thanks for letting me stay in your beautiful home Tony and being so accomodating! :)"
66275,602687038,Everything was perfect! Great location and space- and Tony is an excellent host

66275,622852484,"Very clean, spacious, nice apartment. Great location: across the street from a great park. Lots of food options in the area. 1 minute from the subway."
66275,654893007,"Woah! Tony really is a super host! He was super responsive, recommended yummy places and his home really feels like your home. Hands down would stay here again anytime!"
66275,708677829,"great spot

66275,710915884,"Tony is the most perfect host. He made sure every single aspect of the stay was flawless. His home is beautiful, spacious, and spotlessly clean. His beautiful paintings made the space feel even more serene and relaxing. I very highly recommend staying at Tony's home. Thank you so much Tony, all your kindness is so appreciated, as is your incredible home."""
66275,717623942,"Super host, cozy room and good location. Tony is really kind and responsive before and during stay. Highly recommended."
66275,719391907,Good location. Easy to find street parking.
66275,733330383,"Loved staying at this apartment. It's central, quiet inside, spacious and well thought out in terms of layout. Not to mention the big dining table perfect for working and eating! And, of course, Tony was a fantastic host - quick and friendly communication, super accommodating; had no issues whatsoever and would stay here again!"
66275,737105574,"Tony is an attentive, flexible, and accommodating host. The apartment is large, and has good Wifi, TV, and kitchen appliances. We worked remotely from the apartment for 2 weeks, and it met all of our needs!"
66275,745596787,"Tony is amazing !! Had just a couple of unexpected issues & Tony was on it immediately ! He was so attentive. Communication was A+. Apartment is very simple yet adorable ! Bed was so comfortable & bedding was so soft. The extra mattress on the floor in guest room is a real mattress, not an air mattress which was a plus. Enough room at dining table for guest. Plenty of places to eat near by. 2 train stations very close by as well. Windows open easily if you need cooled down. Less than expected street noise for NYC. The little noises we heard were easily drowned out with our sound machine at night time. Would definitely recommend Tony’s place. We would stay with him again if staying in that area. He is also great to recommend places to eat & things to do."
66275,747144481,"Tony could not be a more hospitable host. He is very responsive and communicates quickly. All of the positive reviews you read about him are true! 

The apartment is in a great location, easily accessible to Chinatown, LES, East village and Nolita. It was super easy to check in and walk to new locations each day. 

My friend and I needed a place where we could work from home and the Internet was super fast. We could both take video calls simultaneously without any problems

Overall, it was a nice space in a good neighborhood, but Tony really went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and taken care of."
66275,749129789,"This was an incredible trip. Tony is an amazing host ... communicates above and beyond what you'd ever expect, gives great recommendations, and hosts a wonderful and QUIET apartment. There's everything you need in this place, including lots of room. But again, can't stress how quiet the place is! The place is in a great spot - walking around downtown is a breeze. It was a pleasure to stay here and we look forward to returning soon."
66275,752387229,"Great place to stay and what a cool scene to eat, bike and explore."
66275,753613331,You’ll have a great base from which to  explore the city with a host who cares that you have a great experience.
66718,596705041,"If you are looking for a cozy and private and a place where you do not have to worry that someone will come and knock because want to clean, then this is the one. if you are looking for a place where you would like to cook for yourself then this is the one. we loved everything about this place.  it is very clean and comfortable,  we had our 8 years old with us by no mean she was homesick. This says everything doesn't? It is very well located and mostly is soooo close to the tube station or subway and not mention the variety of restaurants. Eva"
66718,614014916,"Great location! Would recommend for a group of friends looking to visit New York. The appartement was very well located close to a subway station. 
Thank you Henning!"
66718,627007109,Great space. Excellent location for city college and Columbia
66718,669673223,"Henning's place is impeccably located, quite large, well equipped and very reasonably priced. It is ideal for long stays, being within walking distance to supermarkets, laundromats, more food places than I can count etc. Bad timing, however, was a factor that I had some difficulties during my first couple of weeks in the house.  Damage was done to the apartment from a previous tenant and Henning was away, unable to replace the damaged amenities, hence the bad timing. This resulted in some amenities missing, including a desk chair, which brought some inconvenience since I spend quite a lot of time on my computer. This was not enough to spoil my stay there, however, or my willingness to return to Henning's house should I require such a space again. Despite my briefly inconvenient experience, I would definitely recommend this place to future travelers."
66718,705907385,"Great location, small apartment but very comfortable and clean. Henning was a great host and accommodated our check out changes. We loved our stay and will definitely stay again when back in NYC!"
66718,753684041,"This place was great for a long term rental for several months. Communication was excellent—fast and responsive. Place is a bit quirky in a charming way, and location was very convenient."
66741,587217731,"Great place, close to subway. Recommend!"
66741,589734769,"Perfect location in Park Slope. Great neighborhood. Convenient to stores, restaurants, Metro. Lots of room to spread out but no door on the bedroom. Well stocked kitchenware. Would stay again."
66741,613173950,"Great location, very clean, good supply of kitchen items. Spacious apartment. We had a toddler with us and the layout worked well to put the toddler in the front of the apartment and then we slept in the bedroom. Bed is not very comfortable and the pillows are very uncomfortable. There is a pack n play in the closet, we brought ours because we didn't know so we didn't use it but hope that will save someone else in the future."
66741,619206798,"Our group really liked Stefano's place. He is a great host, very responsive and understanding, he helped us a lot. The apartment is clean and close to a lot of restaurant, one of them is mg favourite bbq place in New York. We're incredibly sorry to leave sooner than expected but we'll definitely go back. 
Highly recommended."
66974,588426534,"This apartment was delightful. Roomy, clean, cozy. It had everything we needed and made for a very enjoyable stay"
66974,617361385,"This is my second stay at Jana's place.  As before, a perfect sanctuary in a very cool part of Brooklyn."

66974,634265261,"The stay was fantastic. It's a great space, well-described, and close to markets, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. Hosts were incredibly responsive and helpful, lots of great tips on the neighborhood. Stay was for 2 weeks with easy and flexible check-in/out process. Will be recommending it to friends without hesitation."
66974,638191183,"Beautiful apartment--VERY spacious, spotlessly clean, nicely decorated with everything needed, very private. Having garden access was especially nice in the summer, and the neighborhood is great. The discount for a week-long rental made the price quite reasonable for the space. Highly recommended for anyone visiting New York."
66974,643416852,"We loved our short staycation at Jana’s lovely place. It was exactly what we needed to refresh our routine, after spending months like many others in our cramped Manhattan apartment. Our daughter enjoyed toddling around in the backyard, and Jana was kind enough to provide many tools to help ward off the mosquitos. The neighborhood is walkable and we enjoyed the surroundings despite heat! Highly recommend staying with Jana if you’re interested in exploring Brooklyn and having a comfortable home base."
66974,644292048,"Very nice modern and sophisticated space and convenient location, we enjoyed our stay! Thanks so much!"
66974,658615384,"Jana’s place is cozy, clean, perfectly located in an awesome area of Brooklyn. Add to that a wonderful outdoor space it really is a hidden gem!!!

Jana is a very thoughtful host and her pro tip on how to deal with the mosquitoes really allowed us to make the most of the cute backyard."
66974,663291762,"Great, clean, open space with a delightful backyard. Came back after a long sojourn to stay in the city, and knew this was the neighborhood to be in. The perfect place to both work and relax during the day and journey out to both Brooklyn and Manhattan. Would absolutely stay again."
66974,666844816,"Perfect location, comfortable cool space in a wonderful BK neighborhood. Private garden is a delight. An unexpected urban  respite. Jana is beyond a super host."
66974,668708813,This place is top notch. Highly recommended! Perhaps the best place I’ve ever stayed.
66974,672972707,"Jana's lovely apartment was the perfect abode for my mother when she visited Brooklyn for two weeks to help me with my newborn. Jana was communicative leading up to the visit and helpful throughout her stay if my mother had any questions. It's a clean, cozy, welcoming space and the perfect spot to call ""home"" for a few days or weeks. Thank you, Jana! My mom will be back :)"
66974,700192822,"Great location in Brooklyn. The apartment is on a very quiet block, but the two main streets in the area, Smith and Court, are only 2 or 3 blocks away with a lot to do. The yard is very big and a nice place to chill if you just want to stay home for the day."
66974,701139506,"Beautiful and comfortable apartment in a perfect location for all that Brooklyn has to offer.  All went smoothly from check in to check out, very clean, comfortable bed, perfect for us.  Thank you Jana for making our stay so lovely."

66974,729036683,Jana's place was spotless and had everything you would need for a stay--from toaster and coffee maker to washer dryer and reliable internet and a sweet outdoor space (though it was too cold to use while I was there).  Highly recommend for anyone who wants a cozy space for a stay in Brooklyn!

66974,734506878,"I stayed as a local staycation birthday getaway and loved it. Very homey and perfect for a single person looking for peace and quiet. The patio is *everything* and I absolutely loved drawing a relaxing epsom salt and lavender bath in the comfy tub!

It was truly a lovely stay, with SO MANY delicious food options on Seamless!"
66974,735917806,A well appointed kitchen and bathroom.  In summer there appears to be a nice backyard.  There was snow on the ground when we were there so obviously didn't venture outside.  The floor plan of the unit is well designed and the space is quite comfortable.
66974,736741587,"Our stay at Jana's was great! The space is exactly as shown in the photographs- sparkling clean, beautifully designed, with every comfort we could desire over the course of our stay. Jana was an incredibly thoughtful and accommodating host, and she answered all of our questions immediately. We'd gladly stay there again."
66974,738317321,"Jana’s place has everything that a traveler could possibly need. Her apartment is sparkling clean and I mean sparkling.  The bedding was also so very comfortable. The neighborhood is cute and feels very safe. 

Jana responded to all inquiries very quickly. She was very easy to work with. 

My son and his family live a few minutes away from Jana’s Airbnb. This was my first visit to Jana’s place but it most definitely won’t be my last. It is now my home away from home. 

Thank you Jana for being an awesome host!"
